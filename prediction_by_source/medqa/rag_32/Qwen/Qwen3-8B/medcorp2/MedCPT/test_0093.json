    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with neurological signs (spasticity, Babinski sign) and a cervical spine clunk, indicating spinal instability. Documents link rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to cervical spine instability (Document 14) and cervical myelopathy (Document 11). Symmetric hand deformities (ulnar deviation, swan neck) are classic RA features (Document 6).
