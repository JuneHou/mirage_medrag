    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.25, HCO3- 11 mEq/L) and low pCO2 (22 mmHg), indicating respiratory compensation. Diarrhea is a classic cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA) due to gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss, as noted in documents [0][11], and aligns with the patient's symptoms. Metformin (C) is associated with lactic acidosis (high anion gap), not NAGMA. Sleep apnea (D) would cause respiratory acidosis, not the observed pattern. Anxiety (A) does not explain the lab findings. The combination of diarrhea, NAGMA, and the patient's history of diabetes (which can exacerbate acid-base imbalances) strongly points to diarrhea as the primary cause.",
