<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 33-year-old nurse with a 17mm PPD induration. She's asymptomatic, normal chest X-ray. The question is about managing latent TB. First, I remember that a positive PPD test in someone without symptoms and a normal chest X-ray usually points to latent TB. The documents mention that if there's no active disease signs, treatment for latent TB is initiated. Looking at the options, option A is Isoniazid, which is a standard treatment for latent TB. The documents [0] and [12] say that if no active disease is found, LTBI treatment should be given. The nurse's risk factors as a healthcare worker might also influence the decision. Option D is for active TB, but her chest X-ray is normal and she has no symptoms. So D is unlikely. Option C suggests repeating PPD, but the docs say if risk is high, you don't repeat. Since she's a nurse, high risk, so no repeat. Option B is no management, but the docs clearly state treatment should start if LTBI is confirmed. So the answer should be A, Isoniazid. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient has a positive PPD (17mm induration) with no symptoms of active TB and a normal chest X-ray, indicating latent TB infection (LTBI). Documents [0] and [12] state that in asymptomatic individuals with normal chest radiographs, LTBI is diagnosed and treatment should be initiated. Isoniazid (option A) is the standard first-line therapy for LTBI. Options C and D are incorrect as repeat testing is unnecessary in high-risk individuals (nurse) and D is for active TB. Option B is incorrect because treatment is indicated for LTBI.", "answer_choice": "A"}
