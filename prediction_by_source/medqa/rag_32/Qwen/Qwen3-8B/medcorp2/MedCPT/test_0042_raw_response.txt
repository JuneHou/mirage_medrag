<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The baby is one day old, presenting with bilious vomiting and not passing meconium. The mother had gestational diabetes and a high AFI (28 cm), which suggests polyhydramnios. The quadruple screen showed decreased AFP, increased beta-hCG, decreased estriol, and increased inhibin A—these are markers that point towards Down syndrome. Also, the baby's abdomen is distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. Looking at the options: Duodenal atresia (A), Meconium ileus (B), Necrotizing enterocolitis (C), Pyloric stenosis (D). Duodenal atresia is a congenital obstruction in the duodenum, leading to bilious vomiting and failure to pass meconium. The polyhydramnios is a key clue here because duodenal atresia can cause obstruction, leading to decreased amniotic fluid intake. Wait, no—actually, polyhydramnios is more associated with conditions that prevent the fetus from swallowing amniotic fluid, like duodenal atresia. The high AFI in the mother's ultrasound supports this. Also, the quadruple screen markers are consistent with Down syndrome, which is a known association with duodenal atresia. Meconium ileus is more common in cystic fibrosis, which is a different set of markers. The mother didn't have CF carriers screened, but the question mentions the baby's presentation. However, the polyhydramnios here is more indicative of duodenal atresia. Necrotizing enterocolitis is more common in preterm infants, but this baby was born at 38 weeks. Pyloric stenosis presents with non-bilious vomiting, so that's less likely. So the key points are the polyhydramnios, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass meconium. Duodenal atresia fits all these. The maternal markers also suggest Down syndrome, which is a risk factor for duodenal atresia. Therefore, the answer is A. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The infant presents with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and polyhydramnios. Maternal history includes gestational diabetes and a quadruple screen suggestive of Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is associated with polyhydramnios (due to impaired amniotic fluid swallowing) and presents with bilious vomiting and meconium retention. The maternal markers (decreased AFP, increased inhibin A) align with Down syndrome, which has a strong association with duodenal atresia. Meconium ileus (B) is linked to cystic fibrosis, which is not indicated here. Necrotizing enterocolitis (C) occurs in preterm infants, and pyloric stenosis (D) causes non-bilious vomiting. The combination of polyhydramnios, bilious vomiting, and meconium retention strongly points to duodenal atresia.", "answer_choice": "A"}
