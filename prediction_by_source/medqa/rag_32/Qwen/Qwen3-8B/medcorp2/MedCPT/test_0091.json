    "step_by_step_thinking": "The question asks which statement is true about a 3-month-old girl with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) undergoing surgical repair. The options relate to endocarditis, hemoglobin, cerebral thrombosis, and heart failure. The documents mention that TOF patients require subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis (MEDCORP, Document 14), but do not specify which valve is most commonly affected by endocarditis (A is unsupported). The documents do not address iron deficiency anemia or hemoglobin levels (B is not directly supported). Cerebrovascular accidents (arterial thrombosis) are listed as a cause of mortality in unrepaired TOF (Document 3), but the comparison to venous thrombosis is not made (C is unsupported). Refractory heart failure is not explicitly mentioned as a common complication (D is unsupported). However, the statement about normal hemoglobin not ruling out iron deficiency anemia (B) is a general medical principle, and while not explicitly stated in the documents, it aligns with clinical practice. Thus, B is the most plausible answer.",
