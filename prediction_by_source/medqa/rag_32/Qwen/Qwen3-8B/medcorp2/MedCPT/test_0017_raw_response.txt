<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The scenario is about a study on BRUE (Brief Resolved Unexplained Event) in infants. The pediatrician is trying to identify risk factors by comparing two groups: 75 infants with BRUE and 75 without. The key here is that the study matched the groups based on age, socioeconomic background, and family history. The question is asking which method was used to control confounding bias. First, I need to recall the options: Blinding, Restriction, Randomization, Matching. Let me think about each. Blinding is about preventing bias in data collection by keeping participants or researchers unaware of group assignments. But the question mentions that the groups were matched on certain factors, so blinding might not be the answer here. Restriction involves limiting the study population to exclude certain factors. For example, only including people of a specific age. However, in this case, the study included infants under 1 year but matched them on age, socioeconomic background, and family history. So restriction might not be the method used here because they're not excluding factors but rather matching them. Randomization is when participants are randomly assigned to groups to ensure that confounding variables are evenly distributed. However, the question states that the groups were matched, not randomly assigned. The study specifically selected infants with the same age, socioeconomic background, etc., so randomization isn't the method here. Matching is when the study pairs participants in the groups based on certain characteristics to control for confounding variables. The scenario clearly states that the groups were matched on age, socioeconomic background, and family history. This directly aligns with the method of matching to control confounding bias. Looking back at the documents provided, Document [3] from MEDCORP talks about the importance of selecting an appropriate control group with similar characteristics. It mentions that the two groups should have similar histories and environments. Document [8] also emphasizes the need for matching controls across factors. The study in the question matched the groups on specific factors, which is exactly what matching entails. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Matching. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The study matched BRUE cases and controls on age, socioeconomic background, and family history to control confounding bias. This aligns with the method of 'matching' described in the documents, which emphasizes ensuring similar characteristics between groups to eliminate confounding variables. The other options (blinding, restriction, randomization) do not fit the described approach.", "answer_choice": "D"}
