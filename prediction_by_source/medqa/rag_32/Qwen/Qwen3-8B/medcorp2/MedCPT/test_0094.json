    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with signs of hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) and physical findings (muffled heart sounds, jugular venous distention) consistent with cardiac tamponade. The stab wound location and clinical course support pericardial injury. Pulsus paradoxus (a drop in systolic blood pressure of \u226510 mmHg during inspiration) is a classic finding in cardiac tamponade. Tracheal deviation (A) suggests tension pneumothorax, which is inconsistent with normal breath sounds. Hemoptysis (B) implies pulmonary injury, not tamponade. Paradoxical chest motion (D) indicates flail chest, which is not supported by the clinical presentation. The most likely finding is pulsus paradoxus (C).",
