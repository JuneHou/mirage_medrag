    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's presentation of severe hip/knee/groin pain, weight-bearing inability, and limited hip motion in an obese 13-year-old male is highly suggestive of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Documents [0][2][3], and [5] explicitly link these symptoms to SCFE, emphasizing obesity as a key risk factor. SCFE requires urgent orthopedic referral and surgical intervention (e.g., surgical pinning) to prevent complications. While casting (A) or observation (C) might be considered, the definitive management for SCFE is surgical stabilization. The Pavlik harness (B) is unrelated to SCFE. The UMLS documents (e.g., [0][1][2]) confirm surgical pinning as part of the treatment for femoral head displacement. Thus, the best management is surgical pinning.",
