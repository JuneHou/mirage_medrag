    "step_by_step_thinking": "The question asks how external beam radiation affects cancer cells. The documents state that ionizing radiation causes DNA damage, specifically double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Document [0] mentions external beam radiation induces DNA damage, including 40 DSBs per 1-2 Gy. Document [3] explains radiation causes direct DNA strand breaks, and Document [5] highlights DSBs leading to chromosomal aberrations. Thymidine dimers (A) are caused by UV radiation, not ionizing radiation. Disulfide bonds (B) relate to proteins, not DNA. Deamination (C) is a chemical modification, not a break. Thus, D is correct.",
    "answer_choice": "D"
