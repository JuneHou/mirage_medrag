    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's history of total thyroidectomy and symptoms of perioral numbness, hand spasms, and nausea suggest hypocalcemia. Documents [0][4][9], and [12] link hypocalcemia to QT prolongation on ECG, which is a risk factor for torsades de pointes. While torsades de pointes (A) is a severe arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation, the question asks for the ECG finding, not the arrhythmia. QT prolongation (B) is the direct ECG abnormality caused by hypocalcemia. Peaked T waves (C) and PR prolongation (D) are not directly linked to hypocalcemia in the provided documents.",
