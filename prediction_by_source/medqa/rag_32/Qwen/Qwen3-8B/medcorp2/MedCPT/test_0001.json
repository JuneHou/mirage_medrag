    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's sensorineural hearing loss is likely due to ototoxic chemotherapy. Documents [0][1][11] link cisplatin and carboplatin (platinum-based agents) to ototoxicity. These drugs' primary mechanism of action against cancer is DNA cross-linking (option D), which disrupts DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. The other options (proteasome inhibition, microtubule stabilization, free radicals) are mechanisms for other drugs (e.g., bortezomib, vincristine, doxorubicin). The question asks for the mechanism of the drug's beneficial effect, not the ototoxicity itself.",
    "answer_choice": "D"
