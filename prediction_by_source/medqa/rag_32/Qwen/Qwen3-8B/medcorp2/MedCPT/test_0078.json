Atrial septostomy is a standard intervention for TGA to improve oxygenation pending surgery. Other options like persistent truncus arteriosus or tricuspid atresia do not fit the radiographic or clinical findings as closely. Coarctation of the aorta lacks the cyanotic presentation and specific imaging features. Document [6] and [13] confirm TGA's association with these findings.",
