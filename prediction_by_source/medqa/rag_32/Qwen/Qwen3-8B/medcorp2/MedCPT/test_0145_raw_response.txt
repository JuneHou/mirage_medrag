<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 5-year-old boy with facial swelling that started 5 days ago. He had a sore throat two weeks prior. The exam shows edema in the upper and lower extremities, periorbital edema, and mild abdominal distension. Lab results show low albumin (2.1 g/dL), high cholesterol and triglycerides, and urine protein is 4+ with no blood or glucose. The key here is to figure out the likely diagnosis based on these findings and then determine the renal biopsy result. First, the history of a sore throat two weeks ago is significant. That makes me think of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). The classic presentation of PSGN includes edema, hypertension, hematuria, and proteinuria. However, in this case, the urine shows proteinuria (4+) but no blood. The edema is prominent, and the low albumin suggests nephrotic syndrome. Wait, but PSGN typically presents with nephritic syndrome (hematuria, hypertension, edema), but the nephrotic syndrome is more associated with minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, the timing of the sore throat aligns with PSGN, which usually occurs 1-3 weeks after a strep infection. But the lab results show low albumin and high cholesterol, which are more indicative of nephrotic syndrome. However, PSGN can sometimes present with nephrotic features. Wait, but the classic triad of PSGN is hematuria, edema, and hypertension. The patient here has edema and proteinuria, but no hematuria. However, the urine test here says blood is negative. Maybe the hematuria is microscopic and not detected here. Or maybe it's a different condition. Another possibility is IgA nephropathy, which can present with hematuria after a sore throat. But the patient's urine doesn't show blood. Also, IgA nephropathy typically has mesangial deposits on biopsy. But the question is about the renal biopsy findings. The options include subepithelial dense deposits (which are seen in membranous glomerulonephritis or PSGN?), deposits of IgG and C3 at the basement membrane (which is characteristic of PSGN), mesangial proliferation (like in minimal change or IgA), or normal findings. Wait, the key here is the history of a sore throat and the presence of proteinuria. PSGN is a type of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. In PSGN, the renal biopsy typically shows proliferation of the glomerular cells (like in the options) and immune complex deposits. On immunofluorescence, PSGN usually shows granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement membrane. That's option C. But wait, the patient's presentation is more towards nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, low albumin, high cholesterol). However, PSGN can have varying presentations. The presence of subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy is characteristic of membranous glomerulonephritis, which is more associated with nephrotic syndrome. But in PSGN, the electron microscopy might show subepithelial deposits. Wait, I need to recall the specifics. In PSGN, the light microscopy shows hypercellular glomeruli with proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells. On immunofluorescence, there are granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane. On electron microscopy, subepithelial dense deposits are seen. So option B is subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy. But the question is about the renal biopsy findings. The options include both light microscopy and electron microscopy findings. Wait, the options are: A. Mesangial proliferation (light microscopy), B. Subepithelial dense deposits (electron microscopy), C. IgG and C3 at basement membrane (immunofluorescence), D. Normal. So, the correct answer would depend on the specific findings. For PSGN, the immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 along the basement membrane (option C). However, the electron microscopy shows subepithelial deposits (option B). But which is more likely here? The patient's presentation is more towards nephrotic syndrome, but the history of a sore throat points to PSGN. However, the presence of proteinuria and low albumin might suggest a different diagnosis. Wait, but PSGN can have varying degrees of proteinuria. The key is that in PSGN, the immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 deposits. So option C. Alternatively, if the biopsy shows subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy, that would be option B. But which is more characteristic? Wait, in PSGN, the electron microscopy typically shows subepithelial dense deposits, which are characteristic. However, the immunofluorescence shows granular deposits of IgG and C3. So both B and C could be possible. But the options are separate. But the question is about the renal biopsy findings. The options are different techniques. The question is asking which finding is most likely. In the case of PSGN, the classic findings on renal biopsy are: light microscopy shows hypercellular glomeruli with proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, and on immunofluorescence, granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane. On electron microscopy, subepithelial dense deposits are seen. So, if the question is about the most likely finding, the answer would depend on the options given. The options include B (subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy) and C (IgG and C3 deposits on immunofluorescence). But the question is from the MEDCORP documents. Looking back, in the retrieved documents, Document [1] and [2] mention PSGN, which is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Document [1] says that PSGN typically presents with nephritic syndrome (hematuria, edema, hypertension). However, the patient here has proteinuria and low albumin, which is more like nephrotic syndrome. But the history of a sore throat is a key clue. Wait, but the patient's urine shows protein 4+ and no blood. However, in PSGN, hematuria is common, but it might be microscopic. The urine test here might not have detected it. In the UMLS documents, the relationship between PSGN and the findings. For example, in the UMLS documents, the term "post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis" is linked to findings like IgG and C3 deposits. So, the correct answer would be option C: deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence. But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. The answer choices are A. Mesangial proliferation (which is seen in minimal change disease or IgA nephropathy), B. Subepithelial dense deposits (seen in membranous glomerulonephritis or PSGN), C. IgG and C3 deposits (PSGN), D. Normal. So, the correct answer is C. Because PSGN is associated with IgG and C3 deposits on immunofluorescence. However, the presence of subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy is also a feature. But the options are separate. But the question is about the renal biopsy findings. The options are different techniques. The answer would depend on which is more characteristic. In the MEDCORP documents, Document [1] and [2] mention PSGN. Document [1] says that PSGN presents with nephritic syndrome, which includes proteinuria. Document [10] says that PSGN has edema in 65-90% of cases. In the UMLS documents, the relationship between PSGN and the findings. For example, Document [3] mentions that acute glomerulonephritis is part of the nephritis, nephrosis, and nephrotic syndrome group. But the key is that in PSGN, the immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 deposits. So the answer is C. But wait, the patient's presentation is more towards nephrotic syndrome. However, PSGN can have varying presentations. The presence of subepithelial deposits on electron microscopy (option B) is also a feature. But the options are separate. The question is which finding is most likely. In the case of PSGN, the classic findings on renal biopsy are: light microscopy shows hypercellular glomeruli, immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 deposits, and electron microscopy shows subepithelial deposits. So, if the options include both B and C, which is more likely? The question is about the renal biopsy findings. The options are different techniques. The answer would depend on the options given. Since the options include C (IgG and C3 deposits on immunofluorescence), which is a key finding in PSGN, that would be the correct answer. Therefore, the answer is C. But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. The answer choices are given as A, B, C, D. Wait, the user's answer choice is to select from A to D. The correct answer is C. But the initial thought process might have considered B. But in the UMLS documents, the term "post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis" is linked to IgG and C3 deposits. So the answer is C. Therefore, the answer is C. But the initial answer given in the example was A. Wait, no, the user's example answer is A, but that's just an example. Wait, the user's example answer is A, but that's not the correct answer here. So, the correct answer
