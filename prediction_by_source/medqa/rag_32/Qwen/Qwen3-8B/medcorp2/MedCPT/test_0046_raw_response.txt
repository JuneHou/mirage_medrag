<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of cardiac death in a trial comparing a novel drug (Medication 1) vs standard therapy (Medication 2). The study had 1,500 patients in each group, and the results show 134 deaths in Medication 1 and 210 in Medication 2. The p-value is 0.03, which indicates a statistically significant difference. First, I need to recall how to calculate NNT. The NNT is calculated as 1 divided by the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference in event rates between the control group and the treatment group. So, let's compute the event rates. For Medication 1 (treatment), the event rate is 134/1500. For Medication 2 (control), it's 210/1500. Calculating those: 134 divided by 1500 equals approximately 0.0893 (or 8.93%). 210 divided by 1500 is 0.14 (or 14%). The ARR is the control rate minus the treatment rate: 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507. Then, NNT is 1 / 0.0507 ≈ 19.72. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives 20. Looking at the options, choice C is 20. But wait, let me double-check the numbers. Wait, the question says the primary endpoint is death from cardiac causes. The numbers given are 134 and 210. So the absolute risk reduction is 210-134 = 76 events. The total number of patients is 3000, so the risk in control is 210/1500 = 0.14, and treatment is 134/1500 ≈ 0.0893. The difference is 0.0507. So 1/0.0507 is approximately 19.72, which rounds to 20. So the answer should be C. But wait, the options include B as 16. Did I make a mistake? Let me check again. Wait, maybe I inverted the treatment and control groups. The novel drug is Medication 1, which has fewer deaths (134 vs 210). So the ARR is 210-134 = 76. The risk in the control group is 210/1500 = 0.14, and treatment is 134/1500 ≈ 0.0893. The ARR is 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507. So NNT is 1/0.0507 ≈ 19.72, which rounds to 20. So the correct answer is C. But the options given are A.5, B.16, C.20, D.50. So the answer should be C. However, looking back at the provided documents, maybe there's a different approach? Wait, the documents mention NNT in some trials, like in Document [0], which has NNT 476 for stroke, but that's for a different study. The question here is about cardiac death, so the documents might not directly relate. The user's question is a standalone calculation. Therefore, the correct NNT is 20, so answer choice C. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "To calculate the NNT for cardiac death, first determine the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).
