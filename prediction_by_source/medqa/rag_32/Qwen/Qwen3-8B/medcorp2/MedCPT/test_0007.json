    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with NSTEMI and undergoes PCI. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is standard post-PCI, combining aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor. Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 inhibitor explicitly recommended in ACS/PCI management (Documents [1][4][13]). Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant but not a P2Y12 inhibitor, and DAPT requires a P2Y12 agent. Nifedipine and spironolactone are not indicated here. The correct choice is clopidogrel.",
