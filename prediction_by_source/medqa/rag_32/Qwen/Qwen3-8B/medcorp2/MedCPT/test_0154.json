Key features include a history of a runny nose, fever, and vesicles on the abdomen and back. Chickenpox (varicella) is characterized by a pruritic rash with macules, papules, vesicles, and crusts, often accompanied by fever and a prodromal runny nose. The rash's distribution and presence of vesicles align with chickenpox.
