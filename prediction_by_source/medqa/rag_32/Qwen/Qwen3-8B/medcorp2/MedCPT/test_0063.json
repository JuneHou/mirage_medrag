    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with postoperative urinary retention (POUR) following hernia surgery, with morphine use, obesity, and an inconclusive bladder scan. Opioids like morphine inhibit parasympathetic function, causing detrusor dysfunction and outlet obstruction, a key mechanism of POUR. Obesity further complicates bladder assessment. The documents emphasize that POUR management includes urethral catheterization (Foley or intermittent) as the initial treatment when retention is suspected, especially with systemic opioids. Bladder scans may be inconclusive due to body habitus, necessitating direct intervention. Aggressive fluids (B) or renal ultrasound (D) are not first-line for POUR. Digital rectal exam (C) is not relevant here. The next best step is catheterization to relieve retention.",
