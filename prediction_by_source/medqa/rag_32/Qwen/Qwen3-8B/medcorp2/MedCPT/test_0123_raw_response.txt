<think> Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 41-year-old G3P1 woman with sudden throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Her aPTT is prolonged at 70s, while PT is normal. The CT scan is non-contrast and presumably negative for hemorrhage since the question is about the next step. First, the key lab findings here are the prolonged aPTT but normal PT. The mixing study is mentioned in the initial documents, which is part of evaluating coagulopathy. The patient's symptoms include neurological deficits (left weakness) and headache, which could point towards a bleeding disorder or something like a stroke. However, the CT is non-contrast, so maybe they're ruling out intracranial hemorrhage. The prolonged aPTT suggests a possible deficiency in factors involved in the intrinsic pathway. The mixing study is used to differentiate between a factor deficiency and a clotting inhibitor like lupus anticoagulant. Since the PT is normal, it's less likely to be a vitamin K deficiency. The patient's history includes two spontaneous abortions, which might be related to antiphospholipid syndrome, but that's a stretch. Looking at the options, the mixing study (A) is the next step to determine if the aPTT is due to a factor deficiency or an inhibitor. The other options: INR (B) is part of PT testing, which is already normal. Ristocetin test (C) is for von Willebrand disease, but the PT is normal, so maybe not. Clot retraction (D) is more for platelet function, but the platelet count is normal. So the mixing study is the best next step here. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with a prolonged aPTT and normal PT, suggesting an intrinsic coagulation pathway defect. The mixing study (A) is critical to differentiate between a factor deficiency (e.g., hemophilia) and a clotting inhibitor (e.g., lupus anticoagulant). Since the PT is normal, INR (B) is redundant. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (C) tests von Willebrand factor, which is not indicated here. Clot retraction (D) assesses platelet function, which is not the primary issue. The mixing study directly addresses the aPTT abnormality.", "answer_choice": "A"}
