    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with short stature, delayed bone age (11 years vs 14 chronological age), and delayed puberty (Tanner stage 2). Family history of delayed puberty (father) suggests constitutional growth delay (CGD). Bone age delay of \u22652 years is consistent with CGD, which typically has a normal final height. The documents emphasize that most short stature cases are benign (FSS/CGD) and require reassurance/follow-up unless red flags exist (e.g., growth velocity <expected, crossing percentiles, comorbidities). No evidence of endocrinopathy or other abnormalities. Pelvic ultrasound (A) is not indicated for CGD without suspicion of hypogonadism. Reassurance and follow-up (C) align with management guidelines for CGD.",
