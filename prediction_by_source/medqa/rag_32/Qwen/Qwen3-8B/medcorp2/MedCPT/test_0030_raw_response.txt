<think> Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with right upper quadrant pain, fever, elevated WBC, and inconclusive ultrasound. Cholescintigraphy shows the bile ducts and small bowel but not the gallbladder. The options are about possible causes. First, the key symptoms are right upper quadrant pain, fever, elevated WBC—these are classic for cholecystitis or cholangitis. But the ultrasound is inconclusive. Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) is used to assess gallbladder function. If the scan shows the bile ducts and small bowel but not the gallbladder, that might indicate a problem with the gallbladder not being visualized, like obstruction. Looking at the options: D is obstruction of the cystic duct. If the cystic duct is blocked, the gallbladder can't empty, leading to inflammation (cholecystitis). But the cholescintigraphy might show delayed emptying or no visualization. However, the question says the scan shows the intrahepatic ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel. If the gallbladder isn't visualized, maybe there's an obstruction preventing the contrast from reaching it. Another option is B, a fistula between gallbladder and small intestine. That would cause the contrast to spill into the intestine, which might explain why the scan shows the small bowel. But the patient has fever and elevated WBC, which points more towards infection rather than a fistula. Option D, cystic duct obstruction, would lead to gallbladder distension and possible cholecystitis. The cholescintigraphy might show the gallbladder not filling, but if the scan shows the ducts and small bowel, maybe the obstruction is causing the contrast to bypass the gallbladder. Wait, the cholescintigraphy findings are a bit unclear. If the scan shows the bile ducts and small bowel but not the gallbladder, that could indicate a blockage in the cystic duct, preventing the contrast from entering the gallbladder. That would support option D. Alternatively, if there's a fistula, the contrast would enter the small bowel, which is what's observed. But the presence of fever and elevated WBC suggests infection, which is more consistent with cholecystitis (D) rather than a fistula (B). Also, the patient's labs show elevated WBC and fever, which aligns with an infectious process. So, obstruction of the cystic duct (D) leading to cholecystitis fits better. The answer is D. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, elevated WBC, and inconclusive ultrasound. Cholescintigraphy shows bile ducts and small bowel but not the gallbladder. Obstruction of the cystic duct (D) would prevent gallbladder visualization on cholescintigraphy, leading to cholecystitis (classic symptoms: pain, fever, elevated WBC). A fistula (B) would allow contrast to spill into the small bowel, but fever and WBC elevation suggest infection rather than a non-obstructive fistula. Hepatotropic virus (C) or pancreatic autodigestion (A) do not align with the imaging findings. The most likely cause is cystic duct obstruction.", "answer_choice": "D"}
