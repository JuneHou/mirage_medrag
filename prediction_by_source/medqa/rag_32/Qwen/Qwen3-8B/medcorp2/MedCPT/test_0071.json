    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's presentation includes a motor vehicle collision (MVC), chest pain, elevated troponins, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Cardiac contusion (A) is a blunt cardiac injury common in MVCs, often presenting with chest pain, elevated troponins, and PCWP elevation due to impaired cardiac function. While pulmonary contusion (C) can cause chest pain, it does not typically elevate troponins. Hemorrhage (B) and Takotsubo (D) are less likely given the trauma context and troponin findings. Documents 0, 1, and 7 emphasize cardiac contusion's association with MVC, troponin elevation, and PCWP changes.",
