    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) following a stroke, with fever, purulent cough, and chest consolidation. The CBC shows neutrophilic leukocytosis (72% neutrophils, 4% bands), indicating a bacterial infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae (A) is a common cause of both community-acquired and HAP, especially in older adults. Document [9] describes typical bacterial pneumonia with neutrophilic response and consolidation, while Document [15] links S. pneumoniae to fever, consolidation, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Staphylococcus aureus (D) is more associated with healthcare-associated pneumonia (e.g., ventilator use) or abscesses, but the patient\u2019s presentation aligns more with S. pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae (C) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (B) are less likely due to clinical features and epidemiology.",
