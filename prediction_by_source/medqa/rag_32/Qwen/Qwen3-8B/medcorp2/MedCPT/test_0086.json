    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with dyspareunia and cyclic pelvic pain, along with rectovaginal tenderness. Endometriosis is a key differential given the symptoms and physical findings. Transvaginal ultrasound is normal, but it may not detect endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis and is recommended when clinical suspicion is high despite normal imaging. Other options like CA-125 (non-specific), hysterectomy (definitive but not first-line), or hysteroscopy (evaluates uterine cavity) are less appropriate here.",
