    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with exercise-induced foot tingling, absent pedal pulses, and a positive straight leg raise (SLR) test. His diabetes, smoking history, and hypertension increase risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Absent pedal pulses suggest arterial insufficiency. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis (A) would cause reduced blood flow to the lower leg, leading to claudication and absent pulses. SLR exacerbates symptoms by increasing venous pressure and reducing arterial perfusion. Aortoiliac stenosis (D) would affect more proximal vessels, but pedal pulses are absent, pointing to distal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis (C) would cause radicular pain, not absent pulses. Acute thrombosis (B) would present with swelling, not absent pulses. The combination of vascular symptoms and SLR findings supports femoropopliteal stenosis.",
