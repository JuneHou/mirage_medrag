    "step_by_step_thinking": "The therapeutic index (TI) is calculated as TD50 (toxic dose in 50% of population) divided by ED50 (effective dose in 50% of population). From the dose-response data, the ED50 is approximately 30 mg (since 26/53 = ~49% response at 30 mg). From the safety profile, TD50 is approximately 80 mg (since 23/47 = ~49% adverse events at 80 mg). TI = 80 mg / 30 mg \u2248 2.67. The closest option is D.",
