    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's history of tricuspid valve replacement and symptoms of fever, weakness, and nail bed hemorrhages (splinter hemorrhages) strongly suggest prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). Documents 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, and 14 highlight that PVE presents with fever, constitutional symptoms, and cutaneous findings like splinter hemorrhages. Friable valve masses (vegetations) are hallmark features of endocarditis, as noted in Document 14 (splinter hemorrhages, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions) and Document 12 (friable valve masses). These masses are indicative of infectious vegetations on the prosthetic valve, which would confirm the diagnosis. Other options (bicuspid valve, papillary muscle rupture, annular calcification) are unrelated to the clinical presentation or the context of prosthetic valve endocarditis.",
