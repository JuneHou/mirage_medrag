<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 37-year-old man rear-ended in a car accident. He has neck pain but no neurological deficits like weakness or numbness. The question is about the next step in the ER. First, I remember that rear-end collisions are associated with whiplash, which can cause cervical spine injuries. The key here is that he has neck pain but no neurological issues. The documents mention that cervical spine injuries need to be considered until ruled out, especially after high-energy trauma like a motor vehicle accident. Looking at the documents, Document [6] talks about cervical collar placement when injury is suspected. Also, Document [14] mentions the NEXUS criteria for cervical spine imaging. The NEXUS rules say that if there's neck pain following a trauma, especially from a motor vehicle accident, imaging might be needed. But the criteria also include factors like midline tenderness, focal deficits, etc. Since the patient has neck pain but no other red flags, maybe imaging is needed. Wait, but the options are lateral cervical film (A), immobilization (B), IV steroids (C), or observation (D). The NEXUS criteria might determine if imaging is required. If the patient meets certain criteria, like having neck pain and a dangerous mechanism (like a rear-end collision), then imaging is indicated. However, if he doesn't meet the criteria, maybe observation is sufficient. But the documents also mention that in cases where cervical spine injury is suspected, a cervical collar should be placed for stabilization. So even if imaging isn't done immediately, immobilization is a next step. However, the question is about the next step upon presentation. Wait, the patient has neck pain and a rear-end collision, which is a high-energy mechanism. According to the NEXUS criteria, if there's neck pain and the mechanism is a motor vehicle accident, then imaging is needed. But the NEXUS criteria also require that the patient doesn't have certain factors like midline tenderness, focal neurological deficits, etc. Since the patient has no neurological deficits, maybe the criteria are met. But the answer options don't include MRI or CT. The options are lateral cervical film, which is part of the initial imaging. However, the NEXUS criteria might recommend imaging if certain criteria are met. Alternatively, if the patient is stable and doesn't meet the criteria, observation might be considered. Wait, the documents mention that in Document [14], the Canadian c-spine rules (NEXUS) recommend imaging if there's posterior midline cervical tenderness, focal deficits, altered mental status, intoxication, or distracting injuries. Also, patients over 65, dangerous mechanism, paresthesia, etc. The patient here has a rear-end collision (dangerous mechanism), neck pain, but no other red flags. So according to NEXUS, if the patient has neck pain and a dangerous mechanism, but no other criteria, then imaging is needed. But the options are lateral cervical film (A) or cervical immobilization (B). Wait, the NEXUS criteria determine if imaging is needed. If imaging is needed, then lateral cervical film would be part of that. However, the next step might be to immobilize first. But the standard approach is to immobilize the cervical spine if injury is suspected, then perform imaging. But the question is about the next step upon presentation. If the patient has a high suspicion for cervical spine injury, then the next step is to immobilize with a collar and then perform imaging. However, if the NEXUS criteria are met, then imaging is required. Alternatively, the answer might be cervical immobilization (B) as the next step, followed by imaging. But the options are A or B. Wait, the options are A. Lateral cervical film, B. Cervical immobilization. Wait, the NEXUS criteria would determine if imaging is needed. If the patient meets the criteria, then imaging is done. But the initial step is to immobilize. So the next step would be to immobilize the cervical spine first. However, the question is about the next step upon presentation. Alternatively, if the patient has neck pain and a rear-end collision, which is a dangerous mechanism, then according to the NEXUS criteria, imaging is required. But the options don't include MRI or CT. The lateral cervical film is part of the initial imaging. However, the answer might be B, cervical immobilization, because the patient needs to be stabilized first. Wait, the documents mention that when cervical spine injury is suspected, a cervical collar should be placed for stabilization until ruled out. So even if imaging is planned, the next step is to immobilize. Therefore, the answer might be B. But the options are A and B. Alternatively, the answer could be A, lateral cervical film, if the NEXUS criteria are met. But the NEXUS criteria would require that if the patient has neck pain and a dangerous mechanism, but no other red flags, then imaging is needed. So the next step would be to perform imaging. However, the options are A (lateral film) or B (immobilization). Wait, the NEXUS criteria are for determining if imaging is needed. If the patient meets the criteria, then imaging is done. But the initial step is to immobilize. So the next step would be to immobilize first, then perform imaging. But the question is about the next step upon presentation. Alternatively, the answer might be B, cervical immobilization, because the patient has a high suspicion for cervical injury. But the documents also mention that in the absence of neurological deficits, maybe observation is possible. However, the mechanism is a rear-end collision, which is a high-energy trauma. Wait, the documents mention that in Document [6], cervical collar should be placed for stabilization until ruled out. So the next step is to immobilize. Therefore, the answer is B. But I need to check the NEXUS criteria again. The NEXUS criteria say that if the patient has neck pain, and the mechanism is a motor vehicle accident, but no other red flags, then imaging is not required. Wait, no. The NEXUS criteria are for determining if imaging is needed. If the patient has neck pain and a dangerous mechanism (like a rear-end collision), but no other red flags (like midline tenderness, focal deficits, etc.), then the criteria might not be met. Wait, the NEXUS criteria include: if the patient has neck pain, and the mechanism is a motor vehicle accident, but no other red flags, then the criteria are not met, so imaging is not required. But the answer might be to immobilize and observe. Alternatively, the answer is B, cervical immobilization, because the patient has a high suspicion for cervical injury. But the documents also mention that in the absence of neurological deficits, maybe observation is possible. However, the documents say that cervical spine injury must be considered until ruled out. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the options again. The options are A. Lateral cervical film, B. Cervical immobilization, C. IV steroids, D. Observation. The correct answer is likely B. Cervical immobilization. Because the patient has a high suspicion for cervical injury (rear-end collision, neck pain), so the next step is to immobilize the cervical spine. Then, based on the NEXUS criteria, decide if imaging is needed. But the question is about the next step upon presentation. So the immediate next step is to immobilize. Therefore, the answer is B. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient sustained a rear-end collision, a high-energy mechanism associated with cervical spine injury risk. Despite no neurological deficits, cervical spine injury must be considered until ruled out. Document [6] emphasizes placing a cervical collar for stabilization when injury is suspected. The NEXUS criteria (Document [14]) guide imaging decisions, but the immediate next step is immobilization to prevent further injury. Lateral cervical film (A) is part of imaging, but immobilization (B) is the priority upon presentation.", "answer_choice": "B"}
