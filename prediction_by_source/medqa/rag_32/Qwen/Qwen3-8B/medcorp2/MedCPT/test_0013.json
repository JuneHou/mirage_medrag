    "step_by_step_thinking": "The mid-systolic murmur at the 2nd left intercostal space, radiating to the carotids, suggests aortic stenosis. Standing reduces preload, which decreases the pressure gradient across the aortic valve, potentially reducing the murmur. However, the question asks about the effect of standing. Diastolic filling time decreases with standing due to increased heart rate (baroreceptor reflex), shortening diastole. This aligns with option D.",
