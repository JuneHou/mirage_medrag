    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with painless hematuria, bladder wall thickening, and biopsy findings consistent with high-grade urothelial carcinoma. Key risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, occupational exposure to aromatic amines (e.g., benzene, aromatic amines), and a history of significant smoking (>30 pack-years). Document [6] explicitly lists aromatic amines as a high-risk factor for urothelial cancer, while other options (ionizing radiation, aflatoxins, radon) are not mentioned as primary risk factors for bladder cancer in the provided documents. The clinical presentation and risk factors align with exposure to aromatic amines.",
