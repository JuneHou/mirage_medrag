    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with acute esophageal variceal bleeding, likely due to cirrhosis from alcoholism. After acute management with octreotide and endoscopic intervention, secondary prevention is needed. Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) like nadolol are indicated to reduce portal pressure and prevent rebleeding, as per documents [0][1][2][6], and [11].
