<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The newborn is 2 days old with jaundice, and the labs show high bilirubin. The mother is Rh-negative with anti-Rh antibodies, and the baby is blood group B, Rh-negative. Wait, the fetal blood group is B and Rh-negative? But the mother is Rh-negative. So, the baby's Rh status is negative, so there's no Rh incompatibility here. But the mother has anti-Rh antibodies. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. If the baby is Rh-negative, then the mother's anti-Rh antibodies wouldn't target the baby's RBCs. But the mother has anti-Rh antibodies, which usually means she's been exposed to Rh-positive blood, like in a previous pregnancy or transfusion. But the baby is Rh-negative, so maybe the antibodies are against something else? Wait, the question says the fetal blood group is B, Rh-negative. So the baby's blood type is B, and Rh-negative. The mother is Rh-negative. So the mother's anti-Rh antibodies would be against the D antigen, but since the baby is Rh-negative, there's no D antigen. So the anti-Rh antibodies might not be causing hemolysis here. But the mother has a positive anti-Rh antibody titer. Wait, maybe the mother has anti-B antibodies? Because the baby is B positive. Wait, the mother's blood group is 0, which is O, so she has anti-A and anti-B antibodies. But the baby is B, so the mother's anti-B antibodies could cross the placenta and cause hemolysis. But the mother is Rh-negative, so her anti-Rh antibodies are against D. But the baby is Rh-negative, so the D antigen isn't present. So the anti-Rh antibodies might not be the issue here. However, the mother's blood group is O, so she has anti-A and anti-B. If the baby is B, then the mother's anti-B antibodies could be causing hemolysis. But the question says the maternal anti-Rh antibody titer is positive. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. The mother is Rh-negative, so her anti-Rh antibodies are anti-D. But the baby is Rh-negative, so the anti-D antibodies wouldn't affect the baby. However, the mother's anti-B antibodies (since she's O) could be causing ABO incompatibility. But the question states that the maternal anti-Rh antibody titer is positive. So maybe the mother has anti-D antibodies, but the baby is Rh-negative, so that's not causing hemolysis. But the baby's blood group is B, so the mother's anti-B antibodies (from her O blood type) could be causing
