    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with signs of DKA (hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia). Initial treatment includes IV fluids, insulin, and potassium management. After treatment, K+ normalized (4.3 mEq/L), glucose is controlled (90 mg/dL), and HCO3- improved. However, DKA requires continued insulin to resolve ketosis and acidosis. Insulin drives K+ into cells, so potassium replacement may be needed if levels drop too low. The next step should include insulin, IV fluids, and glucose (to prevent hypoglycemia) while monitoring electrolytes. Option A covers these elements.",
