    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms of lip smacking, mouth pursing, and excessive blinking are involuntary movements consistent with tardive dyskinesia (TD). Haloperidol, a first-generation antipsychotic, is strongly associated with TD, especially with prolonged use. TD typically develops after months to years of exposure and involves stereotypical movements like those described. Acute dystonia (B) occurs early and is treatable with anticholinergics, while pseudoparkinsonism (C) involves rigidity and tremor, not lip smacking.
