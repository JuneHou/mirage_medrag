    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient has a solid calcified nodule that grew from 8mm to 10mm over 1 year. Document [9] states that for solid nodules >8mm, consider CT at 3 months or PET/CT. However, calcification (Document [13]) and growth rate (2mm/year) may suggest benignity. Document [1] notes no further testing if stable for 2 years, but growth necessitates follow-up. Document [9] recommends CT scans at 3-6, 9-12, and 18-24 months for low-risk patients. Given calcification and the nodule's growth, the next step is CT in 24 months (A).",
