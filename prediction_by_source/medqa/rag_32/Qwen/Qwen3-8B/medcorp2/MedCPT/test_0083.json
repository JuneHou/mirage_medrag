    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with elevated ESR/CRP, neck stiffness, and difficulty combing hair, which are classic symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA). PMR is associated with shoulder/neck stiffness and activity limitations like hair brushing. However, PMR often coexists with GCA, which requires screening for GCA-specific symptoms. Jaw claudication is a key clinical finding in GCA (Document 12, 5, 6). Other options (heliotrope rash, GERD, pink plaques) are unrelated to the described symptoms or inflammatory markers. Screening for jaw claudication is critical to rule out GCA, given the patient's age and lab findings.",
