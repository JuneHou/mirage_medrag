<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 65-year-old man with symptoms of Parkinson's disease: rigidity, slowness, resting tremors, and a shuffling gait. The key point here is that an antiviral drug is prescribed, which alleviates his symptoms. The options are Amantadine, Ribavirin, Levodopa, or Zidovudine. First, I need to recall which of these drugs are antivirals and have uses in Parkinson's. From the documents, Amantadine is mentioned as an antiviral originally used for influenza but later found to help with Parkinson's symptoms. Document 2 says Amantadine was discovered to treat tremors and dyskinesia in Parkinson's. Document 15 mentions that Amantadine is used for Parkinson's disease, given orally at specific doses. Also, Document 0 and 3 talk about Amantadine's use in Parkinson's. Levodopa (option C) is a mainstay treatment for Parkinson's, but it's not an antiviral. Ribavirin and Zidovudine are antivirals, but the documents don't mention them in the context of Parkinson's. The question specifies an antiviral drug that's effective here. Since Amantadine is an antiviral with antiparkinsonian activity, as per Document 3, and is used for Parkinson's, the answer is likely A. Amantadine. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with classic Parkinson's disease symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, shuffling gait). The critical clue is the use of an antiviral drug that alleviates symptoms. Amantadine is explicitly described as an antiviral (originally for influenza) that was later found to treat Parkinson's tremors and dyskinesia (Documents 0, 2, 3, 15). While Levodopa (C) is a mainstay Parkinson's treatment, it is not an antiviral. Ribavirin (B) and Zidovudine (D) are antivirals but not associated with Parkinson's in the documents. Amantadine's dual role as an antiviral and antiparkinsonian agent matches the clinical scenario.", "answer_choice": "A"}
