    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with a prolonged aPTT and normal PT, suggesting an intrinsic coagulation pathway defect. The mixing study (A) is critical to differentiate between a factor deficiency (e.g., hemophilia) and a clotting inhibitor (e.g., lupus anticoagulant). Since the PT is normal, INR (B) is redundant. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (C) tests von Willebrand factor, which is not indicated here. Clot retraction (D) assesses platelet function, which is not the primary issue. The mixing study directly addresses the aPTT abnormality.",
