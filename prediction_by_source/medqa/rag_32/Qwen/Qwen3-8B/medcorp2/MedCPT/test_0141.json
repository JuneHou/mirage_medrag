    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with signs of Cushing's syndrome (obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities). The 48-hour high-dose dexamethasone suppression test failed to suppress cortisol (30 \u00b5g/mL), indicating ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome. Low serum ACTH (2 pg/mL) rules out pituitary or ectopic ACTH sources, pointing to an adrenal etiology (e.g., adrenal adenoma). Imaging the adrenal glands (MRI) is the next step to confirm an adrenal tumor. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (D) is reserved for pituitary vs ectopic differentiation, which is not needed here. Chest MRI (B) is for ectopic sources, which are unlikely with low ACTH. Low-dose dexamethasone (C) is not needed as the high-dose test already confirmed ACTH independence.",
