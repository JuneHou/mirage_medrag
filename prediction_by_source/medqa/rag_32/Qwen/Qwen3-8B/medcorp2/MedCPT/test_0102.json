    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's absent deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) indicate magnesium sulfate toxicity. Documents 0, 2, and 7 explicitly state that magnesium infusion should be stopped and calcium gluconate administered as an antidote when DTRs are absent. Labetalol is not implicated in this toxicity, making stopping it (option B) irrelevant. Lorazepam (option C) is not the antidote for magnesium toxicity. Nerve conduction studies (option D) are not an immediate management step. The correct action is to stop magnesium sulfate and administer calcium gluconate.",
