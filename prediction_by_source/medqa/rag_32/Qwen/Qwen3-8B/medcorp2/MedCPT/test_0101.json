    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with classic Parkinson's disease symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, shuffling gait). The critical clue is the use of an antiviral drug that alleviates symptoms. Amantadine is explicitly described as an antiviral (originally for influenza) that was later found to treat Parkinson's tremors and dyskinesia (Documents 0, 2, 3, 15). While Levodopa (C) is a mainstay Parkinson's treatment, it is not an antiviral. Ribavirin (B) and Zidovudine (D) are antivirals but not associated with Parkinson's in the documents. Amantadine's dual role as an antiviral and antiparkinsonian agent matches the clinical scenario.",
