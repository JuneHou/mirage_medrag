<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 39-year-old man with chest pain, nausea, hypertension, and a history of cocaine use. The key here is to figure out the first management step. First, the chest pain is progressive and radiating to the epigastric area. He has a history of untreated hypertension and recent cocaine abuse. Cocaine use is a big factor here because it can cause cardiovascular issues like hypertension, tachycardia, and coronary vasospasm. Looking at the documents, there's a lot on cocaine toxicity. Document 0 mentions that benzodiazepines are first-line for cardiovascular toxicity and agitation. But the question is about the first step in management. Also, Document 6 says that non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like diltiazem and verapamil reduce hypertension but not tachycardia. However, Document 3 and 6 talk about labetalol being safe and effective for cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia without unopposed alpha-stimulation. Wait, the options are Diltiazem (A), Labetalol (B), Propranolol (C), or reassurance (D). The patient is in marked distress, so reassurance might not be the first step. The first step in managing acute chest pain with cocaine use would likely involve addressing the hypertension and possible coronary issues. But the question is about the first management step. The initial steps in ACS management include oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, etc. However, the patient's cocaine use complicates things. Document 7 mentions nitroglycerin for angina secondary to cocaine use. But Document 6 says that nitroglycerin can lower blood pressure but risks reflex tachycardia. Wait, the first step in management for acute chest pain with cocaine toxicity would be to address the immediate life-threatening issues. The patient has hypertension and chest pain. The options given are all medications. The first step might be to use a medication that can lower blood pressure without causing reflex tachycardia. Labetalol is a mixed beta and alpha blocker, which is safe for cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia, as per Document 6. Diltiazem is a non-dihydropyridine blocker, which reduces hypertension but not tachycardia. However, the patient might have tachycardia from cocaine use. So labetalol (B) might be better. But wait, the question is about the first step. Wait, the initial management steps for ACS include placing on a cardiac monitor, IV access, aspirin, etc. But the options here are specific drugs. The question is about the first step in management, which might be to address the hypertension and chest pain. Looking back, the first step in the management of acute cocaine toxicity is to manage the cardiovascular effects. Benzodiazepines are first-line for agitation and sympathetic outflow, but the options don't include that. The options are Diltiazem, Labetalol, Propranolol, or reassurance. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, but Document 3 mentions that beta-blockers can cause unopposed alpha-stimulation, which is a risk with cocaine. So Propranolol (C) might be contraindicated. Diltiazem (A) is a
