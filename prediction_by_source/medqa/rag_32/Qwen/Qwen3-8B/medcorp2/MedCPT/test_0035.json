    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with nail pitting, joint swelling (knees and back), and a history of arthritis. Nail pitting is a hallmark of psoriatic arthritis (Document [0][7]). Psoriatic arthritis often involves peripheral arthritis (Document [2]) and axial involvement like sacroiliitis (Document [10]). The presence of dandruff is less relevant here. Rheumatoid arthritis typically shows symmetric joint involvement and positive rheumatoid factor, which isn't mentioned.

The CASPAR criteria (Document [0]) align with psoriatic arthritis.",
