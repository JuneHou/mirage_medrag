    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms (facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, abdominal cramps) after alcohol consumption while on metronidazole are classic signs of a disulfiram-like reaction. Metronidazole inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), preventing the metabolism of acetaldehyde (a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism). This leads to acetaldehyde accumulation, causing the observed symptoms. The question asks which serum level is elevated. Since acetaldehyde is not metabolized properly, its levels rise. Other options (uric acid, cytochrome P-450 enzymes, amylase) are unrelated to this specific interaction.",
