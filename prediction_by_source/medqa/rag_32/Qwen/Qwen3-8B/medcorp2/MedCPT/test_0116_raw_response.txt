<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 16-year-old boy with seizures, cognitive delay, a cardiac murmur, and retinal calcifications. The key here is to connect these symptoms to a genetic disorder. First, the retinal calcifications are mentioned. From the documents, I remember that TORCH infections can cause chorioretinitis and intracranial calcifications. But the patient also has a cardiac murmur and cognitive delay. Looking at the documents, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is associated with cardiac anomalies like patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and retinal issues like chorioretinitis and microphthalmos. Also, cognitive delay and seizures are noted. Another document mentions Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), which is linked to the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. TSC can cause seizures, cognitive delays, and retinal calcifications. The cardiac murmur might be due to rhabdomyomas, which are common in TSC. Also, the fundoscopic findings of calcified lesions fit with TSC's retinal changes. Wait, the options include TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 (option C). The other options are NF1, NF2, and VHL. NF1 is associated with neurofibromatosis, which has café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, not retinal calcifications. NF2 is linked to bilateral vestibular schwannomas. VHL is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, which includes retinal hemangioblastomas. The cardiac murmur in TSC is due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, which are benign tumors. The retinal calcifications in TSC are called "retinal hamartomas" or "calcified lesions." The combination of seizures, cognitive delay, retinal calcifications, and cardiac murmur points towards TSC. So the answer should be C, TSC1 gene. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with seizures, cognitive delay, retinal calcifications, and a cardiac murmur. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is associated with these findings, including retinal calcifications (choroidal hamartomas), cardiac rhabdomyomas (causing murmurs), seizures, and cognitive impairment. The TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 is linked to TSC. Other options (NF1, NF2, VHL) do not align with the retinal calcifications and cardiac murmur described.", "answer_choice": "C"}
