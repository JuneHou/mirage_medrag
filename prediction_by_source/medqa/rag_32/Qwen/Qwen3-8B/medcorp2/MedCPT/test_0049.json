    "step_by_step_thinking": "The question asks about alveolar regeneration after influenza-induced lung injury. Document [3] states that influenza can lead to epithelial regeneration and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, which are surfactant-secreting cells. Document [1] describes the proliferative phase of ARDS involving restoration of epithelial barriers. Type II pneumocytes are critical for alveolar repair and surfactant production. While Document [7] mentions alveolar macrophages aiding tissue repair, the direct regeneration of alveolar lining involves surfactant-secreting cells. Club cells (option D) are involved in detoxification but not primary alveolar regeneration. Ciliated cells (A) and goblet cells (B) are associated with mucus clearance, not regeneration.",
