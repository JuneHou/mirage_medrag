    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with B symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, fever) and is diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. While Hodgkin lymphoma is not classically associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the MEDCORP documents mention EBV in the context of lymphomas, particularly in AIDS-related cases. The UMLS documents highlight EBV's role in oncolytic virotherapy and its association with hematologic malignancies. Although EBV is more commonly linked to non-Hodgkin lymphomas like Burkitt's, the presence of B symptoms and the lack of a stronger association with other viruses (e.g., HHV-8 or HPV16) in the documents make EBV the most likely candidate. The question asks for the viral infection most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis, and EBV is the only virus explicitly mentioned in the context of lymphomas in the provided documents.",
