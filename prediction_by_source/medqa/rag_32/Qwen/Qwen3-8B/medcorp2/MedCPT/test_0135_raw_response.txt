<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The researcher found CD8-positive cells, which are CD8 T cells or cytotoxic T cells. They mixed these with infected cells, crosslinked, and immunoprecipitated CD8. The protein bound to CD8 is from an adjacent cell and has two chains. First, CD8 is a co-receptor on T cells, especially cytotoxic T cells. Its main role is to help the T cell receptor (TCR) bind to MHC class I molecules on infected cells. So, the CD8 protein is involved in the interaction between the T cell and the infected cell's MHC-I. The question is about the protein bound to CD8. Since CD8 is associated with MHC class I, the protein in question is likely part of the MHC class I complex. MHC class I molecules present endogenous peptides (from intracellular pathogens like viruses) to CD8+ T cells. The MHC class I molecule is composed of the heavy chain and a beta-2 microglobulin (β2m) chain. The researcher mentions that the protein bound to CD8 is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. MHC class I molecules have two chains: the heavy chain and β2m. So, the two chains would be part of the MHC-I complex. Now, looking at the options: A. Binds complement proteins – Complement is part of the innate immune system, not directly related to MHC class I. B. Binds endogenous peptides in endosome – Endogenous peptides are processed in the cytosol, not endosomes. Endosomes are more for exogenous antigens. C. Binds endogenous peptides transported by TAP – TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) moves endogenous peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they bind to MHC class I. So, the MHC class I molecule (heavy chain + β2m) would present these peptides. D. Binds exogenous peptides in endosome – Exogenous peptides are processed via endosomes and presented by MHC class II, not CD8+ T cells. So the correct answer should be C. The protein is MHC class I, which binds endogenous peptides transported by TAP. The two chains are the heavy chain and β2m. The CD8 binds to the MHC class I molecule, helping the T cell recognize the infected cell. Therefore, the protein identified is the MHC class I complex, which presents endogenous peptides via TAP. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "CD8+ T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class I molecules on infected cells. The MHC class I complex consists of a heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m), which are transported to the cell surface. The heavy chain binds endogenous peptides generated from intracellular pathogens (like HIV) via the TAP channel. The immunoprecipitated CD8-bound protein likely refers to the MHC class I complex, which presents these endogenous peptides. The two-chain structure matches the MHC class I heavy chain and β2m. This aligns with option C.", "answer_choice": "C"}
