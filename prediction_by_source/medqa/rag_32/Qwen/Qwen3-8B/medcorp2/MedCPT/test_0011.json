    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with symptoms and lab findings consistent with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), including splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, and a positive JAK2 mutation. Ruxolitinib is specifically indicated for high-risk PMF and has been shown to reduce spleen volume and improve symptoms. The COMFORT trials demonstrated its efficacy in intermediate and high-risk PMF. Other options like imatinib (C) target BCR-ABL, which is not the mutation here. Cladribine (A) and prednisone (B) are not first-line treatments for PMF. Documents [5][9], and [10] support ruxolitinib as the correct choice.",
