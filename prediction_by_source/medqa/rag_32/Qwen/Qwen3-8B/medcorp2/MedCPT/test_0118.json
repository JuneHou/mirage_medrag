    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's smoking history, symptoms of shortness of breath, and PFT results (FEV1/FVC 60%, FEV1 50% predicted, elevated TLC/RV) are classic for COPD. The FEV1/FVC <0.7 confirms airflow obstruction, and the lung volumes indicate air trapping. DLCO reduction aligns with COPD. Other options like asbestosis (linked to occupational exposure but not smoking) or IPF (restrictive pattern) don't fit the obstructive PFT findings. Bronchiectasis typically presents with recurrent infections and different PFT patterns.",
