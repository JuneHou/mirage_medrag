    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient is infected with a virus having a helical capsid and segmented genome, which identifies it as Influenza A virus. The son is asymptomatic despite exposure. CCR5 is a co-receptor for HIV, not Influenza. However, the question links CCR5 mutation to asymptomatic exposure. The UMLS documents mention CCR5 as a target for antivirals, but Influenza uses sialic acid receptors. The son's asymptomatic status might be due to a mutation preventing viral entry, but CCR5 is not the receptor for Influenza. The correct answer is D, as it's the only option related to CCR5, though the reasoning is based on the provided documents' context.",
    "answer_choice": "D"
