<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis. He has a new liver nodule found on ultrasound, and the follow-up CT shows a 2 cm lesion in the right hepatic lobe with arterial phase enhancement but no hypodense attenuation in venous or delayed phases. The question is about the next step in management. First, I need to recall the imaging characteristics of liver lesions in cirrhosis. The CT findings here are arterial phase enhancement without washout. From the documents, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically shows arterial phase enhancement with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases. However, this lesion doesn't have washout, which might suggest something else. Looking at the documents, fibrolamellar HCC can have increased contrast avidity in the arterial phase, and some may have delayed phase enhancement. But the key here is the absence of washout. Also, hemangiomas usually show peripheral enhancement with centripetal filling, and they don't wash out. However, in cirrhosis, hemangiomas might mimic HCC. But the patient has cirrhosis, so HCC is a concern. Wait, the CT findings here are a 2 cm lesion with arterial enhancement and no hypodense attenuation in venous or delayed phases. The documents mention that HCC typically has washout, but if there's no washout, maybe it's a hemangioma? But hemangiomas usually have a central scar and centripetal filling. However, the patient has cirrhosis, which might alter the appearance. Another point: the documents mention that in cirrhosis, the presence of a hypervascular nodule with arterial enhancement and no washout could be HCC, but sometimes hemangiomas can mimic HCC. However, the absence of washout might make HCC less likely. But the documents also say that in some cases, HCC might not show washout, especially if there's an arterioportal shunt. But the question is about the next step. The options are biopsy, surgical resection, ablation, or observation. The LI-RADS criteria are mentioned in document 8, which says that HCC should have non-peripheral washout in portal or delayed phases. If there's no washout, maybe it's not HCC. However, the patient has cirrhosis, so HCC is a concern. But the CT findings here don't show washout. So maybe it's a hemangioma? But hemangiomas usually have a central scar. However, the documents mention that in cirrhosis, hemangiomas can lose their typical pattern. Also, the presence of a central scar in the delayed phase might be a clue. Alternatively, the lesion could be a regenerative nodule or a benign lesion. But given the patient's cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is high. However, the imaging features are not classic for HCC. The next step would be to determine if it's malignant. Since the CT doesn't show washout, maybe a biopsy is needed to confirm. However, the documents mention that in some cases, like hemangiomas, the imaging can be misleading. But the patient has cirrhosis, so HCC is a concern. Wait, the documents also mention that in the case of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout, it might be a hemangioma. But the presence of cirrhosis might make HCC more likely. However, the absence of washout is a key differentiator. In the absence of washout, the likelihood of HCC is lower. So maybe the next step is to observe and get follow-up imaging. But the options include observation. However, the patient has a 2 cm lesion. The documents mention that for HCC, if the lesion is 2 cm, it's considered for treatment. But if it's a hemangioma, observation is appropriate. But the question is about the next step. The answer might depend on the imaging features. Since the lesion doesn't show washout, it's less likely to be HCC. However, the presence of cirrhosis and the patient's risk factors (alcohol) make HCC a concern. Alternatively, the documents mention that in some cases, like fibrolamellar HCC, the enhancement pattern is different. But the key is the absence of washout. In the absence of washout, the next step might be to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. However, the answer options include liver biopsy (A), which is a possible choice. But some guidelines might suggest observation if the lesion is not typical for HCC. Wait, the documents mention that in the case of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout, it could be a hemangioma. But in cirrhosis, hemangiomas can be difficult to distinguish. However, the presence of a central scar might help. But the patient's lesion doesn't have a central scar. The documents mention that hemangiomas can have a central scar, but in this case, the CT doesn't show hypodense attenuation in venous or delayed phases, which might be a sign of a central scar. Alternatively, the absence of washout might indicate a benign lesion. However, the patient's cirrhosis increases the risk of HCC. In this case, the next step might be to perform a liver biopsy (A) to confirm the diagnosis. However, some guidelines might suggest observation if the lesion is not typical for HCC. But the answer options include D (observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months). However, the presence of a 2 cm lesion in a cirrhotic patient with risk factors for HCC might require more aggressive management. Wait, the documents mention that in the LI-RADS criteria, HCC is classified based on certain features. If the lesion doesn't meet the criteria for HCC, then it might be considered a benign lesion. However, the absence of washout might make it less likely to be HCC. In that case, the next step could be observation. But the answer options include D. However, the presence of a 2 cm lesion in a cirrhotic patient might require further evaluation. Alternatively, the answer might be to refer for surgical resection (B) or ablation (C). But the documents mention that for HCC, if the lesion is resectable, surgery is an option. However, the absence of washout might make it less likely to be HCC. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the documents again. Document 8 mentions that HCC should have non-peripheral washout in portal or delayed phases. The patient's lesion doesn't have that. So it's not meeting the LI-RADS criteria for HCC. Therefore, it might be a benign lesion. In that case, the next step would be observation. But the answer options include D. However, the patient has a 2 cm lesion. The documents mention that in some cases, like hemangiomas, observation is appropriate. But the patient has cirrhosis, so the risk of HCC is high. However, the imaging features don't fit HCC. Therefore, the next step might be to observe and get follow-up imaging. But the answer options include D. However, the answer might be A (liver biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis. Alternatively, the answer might be D. But the documents mention that in the case of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout, it's more likely a hemangioma. However, in cirrhosis, hemangiomas can be difficult to distinguish. In this case, the next step would be to perform a liver biopsy (A) to confirm the diagnosis. But some guidelines might suggest observation. Hmm. The answer might be A or D. But according to the documents, the presence of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout might be a hemangioma. However, in cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is high. But the absence of washout is a key feature. Therefore, the next step might be to observe and get follow-up imaging. But the answer options include D. Alternatively, the answer might be A. I think the correct answer is A. Because the imaging is not definitive, and the patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of HCC. Therefore, a liver biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the documents mention that in the case of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout, it's more likely a hemangioma. Therefore, the next step would be observation. But the answer options include D. Wait, the question is about the next step. If the lesion is a hemangioma, then observation is appropriate. If it's HCC, then treatment is needed. But the imaging doesn't show washout, which is a key feature of HCC. Therefore, the next step might be to observe. But the answer options include D. So, the answer is D. But I'm confused. Let me check the documents again. Document 8 says that HCC should have non-peripheral washout in portal or delayed phases. The patient's lesion doesn't have that. Therefore, it's not HCC. So the next step is to consider other diagnoses, like hemangioma. In that case, the next step would be observation. Therefore, the answer is D. But the answer options include D. So the answer is D. But the initial thought was A. Hmm. I think the correct answer is D. Because the imaging features don't meet the criteria for HCC, so observation is appropriate. But the answer might be A. Wait, the documents mention that in the case of a lesion with arterial enhancement without washout, it's more likely a hemangioma. Therefore, the next step is observation. So the answer is D. But the answer options include D. Therefore, the answer is D. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient has a 2 cm liver lesion in cirrhosis with arterial phase enhancement but no washout in venous/delayed phases.
