    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with signs and symptoms of Graves' disease, including proptosis, eyelid retraction, and extraocular muscle enlargement, confirming Graves' orbitopathy. The question asks which treatment would transiently worsen her eye symptoms. Radioactive iodine (RAI) is contraindicated in active Graves' orbitopathy, as it can exacerbate the condition by increasing thyroid hormone levels and worsening inflammation. Document 5 explicitly states that RAI is contraindicated in moderate-to-severe active Graves' orbitopathy, making it the correct answer. Corticosteroids (C) are used to treat active orbitopathy, selenium (B) has doubtful benefits, and external orbital radiation (A) is not a standard first-line treatment for transient worsening.",
