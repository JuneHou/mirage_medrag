    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular cycles, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic discomfort, all classic symptoms of uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). Document [5] and [6] explicitly link fibroids to heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. Fibroids often cause a palpable, enlarged uterus. A 10-week-sized uterus (A) is consistent with fibroid-related enlargement, while an adnexal mass (B) is less likely given the symptomatology. The 'globular' description aligns with fibroid-induced uterine distortion. Other options (C, D) do not fit the clinical picture as closely.",
