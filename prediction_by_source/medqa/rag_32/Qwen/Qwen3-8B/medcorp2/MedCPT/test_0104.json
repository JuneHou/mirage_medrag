    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with shortness of breath, wide pulse pressure (136/58), bounding pulses, and specific murmurs. The early diastolic blowing murmur at the left sternal border and late diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex are classic for aortic regurgitation (AR). The Austin Flint murmur (apex rumble) occurs due to regurgitant jet impacting the mitral valve. Bounding pulses (Corrigan's pulse) and S3 gallop are also hallmark findings in AR. Mitral regurgitation (A) presents with holosystolic murmurs, aortic stenosis (C) with systolic ejection murmurs, and mitral prolapse (D) with mid-systolic clicks. The diastolic murmurs and wide pulse pressure strongly point to AR.",
