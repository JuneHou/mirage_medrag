    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with erectile dysfunction, buttock pain relieved by rest (claudication), weak femoral pulses, and risk factors (diabetes, smoking, hypertension). These findings align with aortoiliac atherosclerosis, which causes reduced blood flow to the lower extremities and pelvis. Document [1] describes L\u00e9riche syndrome as a triad of erectile dysfunction, claudication, and diminished pulses, with risk factors matching the patient's history.
