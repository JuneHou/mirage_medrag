    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's chest pain is meal-related and relieved by calcium carbonate, pointing to a gastrointestinal cause. MEDCORP documents link gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal spasm to meal timing. UMLS documents confirm calcium carbonate treats GERD, dyspepsia, and functional GI disorders. The normal ECG rules out acute coronary syndrome, while stable angina is relieved by rest/nitrates, not calcium carbonate. Gastroesophageal junction incompetence (C) aligns with meal-triggered symptoms and antacid relief, unlike other options.",
