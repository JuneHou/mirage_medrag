    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with altered mental status, slurred speech, ataxia, and an alcohol smell, with a BAC of 0.04%. Document 1 states that at 0.05%-0.1% BAC, patients develop impaired judgment and coordination, which matches the symptoms. Document 8 lists ethanol toxicity as a differential diagnosis with similar findings. The BAC level and clinical presentation (alcohol smell, slurred speech, ataxia) directly point to ethanol intoxication. Other options like hypoglycemia, cannabis, or benzodiazepines lack supporting evidence in the context of the BAC and alcohol-related symptoms.",
