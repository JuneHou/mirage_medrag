    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms of fluent speech, intact comprehension, and inability to repeat verbal tasks align with conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, which connects the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area).

Documents [1][3], and [13] support this, highlighting the arcuate fasciculus's role in repetition deficits.",
