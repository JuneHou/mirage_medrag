<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 19-year-old man with symptoms of oral candidiasis. The key points here are the white film that's easily brushed off, the pseudomembranes, and the metallic taste. The question is about the mechanism of action of the appropriate medication. First, I need to recall the treatment for oral candidiasis. From the documents, topical antifungals like nystatin, clotrimazole, miconazole are mentioned. But the question is about the mechanism. The UMLS documents talk about different antifungal classes. Looking at the UMLS sources, there's a document that explains triazole derivatives like itraconazole, fluconazole, and voriconazole. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which disrupts ergosterol synthesis. This is option C. Another document mentions imidazole derivatives, which also inhibit ergosterol synthesis. However, the question is about the mechanism. The answer options include disruption of cell membrane permeability (A), which might relate to ergosterol disruption. But the specific mechanism mentioned in the UMLS documents is inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase (C). Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. The correct mechanism for triazoles and imidazoles is inhibiting 14-alpha-demethylase, which is part of ergosterol synthesis. So option C is correct. The answer should be C. But let me check the options again. The choices are A through D. The UMLS documents specifically mention that triazoles inhibit lanosterol 14α-demethylase, which is option C. So the answer is C. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with symptoms of oral candidiasis, including white pseudomembranes and a metallic taste. The treatment for oral candidiasis typically involves antifungal agents. The UMLS documents explain that triazole derivatives (e.g., fluconazole, itraconazole) inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and compromising fungal cell membrane integrity. This mechanism is directly linked to option C. Other mechanisms (e.g., beta-glucan synthase inhibition) are associated with different antifungal classes (e.g., echinocandins).", "answer_choice": "C"}
