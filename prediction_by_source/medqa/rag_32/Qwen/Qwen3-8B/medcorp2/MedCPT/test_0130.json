    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (direct bilirubin 12.3 mg/dL), elevated ALP (2007 U/L), pale stools, and liver enlargement. These findings strongly suggest biliary obstruction. Biliary atresia (B) is the most common cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infants, typically presenting between 2-4 weeks of age with jaundice, pale stools, and liver enlargement. The elevated ALP and absence of significant hepatocellular injury (normal AST/ALT) align with biliary obstruction. Galactosemia (A) presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and metabolic symptoms. Crigler-Najjar (C) is unconjugated. Breast milk jaundice (D) is unconjugated and resolves with formula. The clinical and lab findings are most consistent with biliary atresia.",
