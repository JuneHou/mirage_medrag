    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's asthma is exacerbated by seasonal allergens, indicating an IgE-mediated allergic response. The experimental therapy targets a mediator involved in antibody class switching from IgM to IgE, which is critical for allergic reactions. Document [3] and [7] explicitly state that IL-4 and IL-13 drive this class switching. Since the therapy reduces this mechanism to attenuate the allergic response, the mediator is IL-4. Other options like IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) or IL-2 (cell proliferation) do not fit the class-switching role described. The answer is D. IL-4.",
