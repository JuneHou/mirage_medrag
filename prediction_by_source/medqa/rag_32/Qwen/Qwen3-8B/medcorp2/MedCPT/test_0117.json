    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate, high anion gap) and elevated creatinine, indicating acute kidney injury. His history of diabetic nephropathy and renal failure (eGFR <30) makes metformin contraindicated, as it increases lactic acidosis risk. The high anion gap suggests lactic acidosis, which aligns with metformin toxicity in renal failure. Other options (Acyclovir, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol) do not directly cause this specific acid-base disturbance. Metformin's role in lactic acidosis with renal failure is well-documented in the documents.",
