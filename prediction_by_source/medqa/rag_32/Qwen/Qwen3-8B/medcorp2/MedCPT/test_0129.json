    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with sudden vision loss, diplopia, cranial nerve palsy, and food poisoning symptoms. Botulism (Clostridium botulinum) is a foodborne illness causing descending paralysis, starting with bulbar symptoms like double vision, blurred vision, and cranial nerve palsies. Fixed dilated pupils and third nerve palsy can occur due to toxin-induced cranial nerve dysfunction. Botulism inhibits acetylcholine release, leading to flaccid paralysis. Other options (nerve agents, organophosphates) cause cholinergic overstimulation, not decreased acetylcholine. The clinical presentation aligns with botulism's pathogenesis.",
