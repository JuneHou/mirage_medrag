    "step_by_step_thinking": "The infant presents with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and polyhydramnios. Maternal history includes gestational diabetes and a quadruple screen suggestive of Down syndrome. Duodenal atresia is associated with polyhydramnios (due to impaired amniotic fluid swallowing) and presents with bilious vomiting and meconium retention. The maternal markers (decreased AFP, increased inhibin A) align with Down syndrome, which has a strong association with duodenal atresia. Meconium ileus (B) is linked to cystic fibrosis, which is not indicated here. Necrotizing enterocolitis (C) occurs in preterm infants, and pyloric stenosis (D) causes non-bilious vomiting. The combination of polyhydramnios, bilious vomiting, and meconium retention strongly points to duodenal atresia.",
