<think> Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 7-year-old boy with nocturnal enuresis, no daytime incontinence. The parents mention he's been dry all day since age 4 but never had a week of continuous dryness at night. Labs are normal, including urine culture, specific gravity, and no RBCs or pus cells. First, I need to recall the management of primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE). The key points from the documents mention that primary enuresis is often due to a combination of factors like bladder capacity and nighttime urine production, and the child's inability to wake up. The documents emphasize non-pharmacologic treatments first, like the bell and pad method (enuresis alarm), which has a 75% success rate. Also, bladder training is mentioned, but since the question is about nocturnal enuresis specifically, maybe the alarm is more relevant here. The documents from MEDCORP mention that the bell and pad method is the first-line treatment, especially if the child can wake to the alarm. The UMLS documents talk about anticholinergics like oxybutynin and imipramine, but those are usually considered if non-pharmacologic methods fail. However, the question states that the labs are normal, so there's no need for further testing like MRI (option A) unless there's a suspicion of neurological issues, which isn't indicated here. The parents aren't concerned about daytime symptoms, so maybe the alarm is the next step. The answer choices include B (reassure and use alarm) which aligns with the first-line treatment. Options C and D are pharmacologic, which are typically second-line. So the correct answer should be B. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), characterized by no daytime incontinence and normal labs. The key management steps for PNE include non-pharmacologic interventions first. Document [9] highlights the bell and pad method (enuresis alarm) as the most effective first-line treatment with a 75% success rate. Document [13] emphasizes the importance of non-pharmacologic approaches and family involvement. MRI (A) is unnecessary without neurological concerns. Pharmacologic options like oxybutynin (C) or imipramine (D) are second-line. Reassurance and enuresis alarm (B) align with first-line management.", "answer_choice": "B"}
