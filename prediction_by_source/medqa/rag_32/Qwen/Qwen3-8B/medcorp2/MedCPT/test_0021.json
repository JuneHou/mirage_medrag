    "step_by_step_thinking": "The infant presents with a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border, feeding difficulty, fatigue, and coughing. Document 4 and 11 link holosystolic murmurs to ventricular septal defects (VSD) and pulmonary atresia with VSD, which are congenital heart defects. The UMLS documents (particularly Document 15) associate 22q11 deletion with congenital heart defects (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia) and systemic symptoms like feeding difficulties and fatigue. Other options (chromosome 7 deletion, lithium, alcohol) are not directly tied to the described murmur and symptoms in the provided documents. The 22q11 deletion syndrome is the most likely cause.",
