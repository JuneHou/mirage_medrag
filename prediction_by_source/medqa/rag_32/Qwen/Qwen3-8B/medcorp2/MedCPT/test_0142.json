    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms of peripheral neuropathy following vincristine chemotherapy are consistent with the drug's mechanism of action. Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, disrupts microtubule dynamics by binding to beta-tubulin, inhibiting polymerization and elongation. This interferes with axonal transport and leads to neurotoxicity. The documents explicitly state that vincristine binds to tubulin subunits, preventing microtubule formation, which directly correlates with option A. Other options describe mechanisms unrelated to vincristine's known effects (e.g., DNA damage or folate inhibition).",
