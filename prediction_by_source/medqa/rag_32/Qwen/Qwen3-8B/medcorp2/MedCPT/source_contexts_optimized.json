Patients that present with mild to moderate poisoning exhibit more anticholinergic symptoms, which include dry mucous membranes, disorientation, tachycardia, mydriasis, urinary retention, hyperthermia, and decreased bowel sounds. Patients with more severe toxicity may also have severe delirium, seizures, psychosis, hypotension, dystonic reactions, hallucinations, and cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., QT prolongation and QRS prolongation). In rare cases, there are reports of rhabdomyolysis and renal failure in patients with prolonged agitation, coma, or seizures.\nDocument [1] (Title: Anticholinergic Toxicity -- History and Physical) The clinician must be familiar with the anticholinergic toxidrome as a reliable history is not always obtainable. The mnemonic \u201cred as a beet, dry as a bone, blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, hot as a hare, full as a flask\u201d is helpful to remember the classic signs and symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning. Respectively, these include flushing, anhydrosis, dry mucous membranes, mydriasis, altered mental status, fever, and urinary retention. Decreased bowel sounds are also a common physical exam finding. Central nervous system effects may include delirium, hallucinations, agitation, restlessness, confusion, staccato speech, and picking at clothing and bedding. Seizures and jerking movements are possible. [22] [23] Diphenhydramine, in particular,\u00a0has been reported to be associated with wide-complex tachycardia and QT prolongation. [24] [25]\nDocument [2] (Title: Diphenhydramine Toxicity -- Differential Diagnosis) The differential diagnosis should include any substance or condition that may alter mentation, result in tachycardia, urinary retention, seizures, or other anticholinergic effects. Other organic processes should also be included, such as meningitis or sepsis. To help with ruling out causes, the time of onset of delirium is important. Toxin-induced delirium occurs more rapidly and abruptly than organic causes. In patients with altered mental status, hyperthermia, and agitation, salicylate toxicity should also be ruled out.\nDocument [3] (Title: Diphenhydramine -- Toxicity -- Signs and Symptoms of Overdose) Diphenhydramine overdose\u00a0can cause significant toxicity and result in various sequelae, including agitation, cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis and the classic anticholinergic toxidrome. [39] [40] [41] [42] [41] [39] Signs and symptoms\u00a0of a diphenhydramine overdose are listed below. Delirium Agitation Confusion Restlessness Hallucinations Ataxia Tremor Seizure Dry sweat glands and mucous membranes Flushed skin Elevated body temperature Mydriasis and blurry vision Urinary retention Tachycardia Rhabdomyolysis\nDocument [4] (Title: Tricyclic Antidepressant Toxicity -- Evaluation) Cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and neurologic manifestations are common. Vital signs may be abnormal. The patient may not be able to protect his or her airway. Respiratory depression may occur. Sinus tachycardia is commonly present due to anticholinergic toxicity, but more dangerous tachydysrhythmias and even bradycardia with or without heart block can occur. Hypotension can occur due to dehydration, cardiac toxicity, and alpha-adrenergic blockade. The patient may often demonstrate anticholinergic toxicity, such as fever, dilated pupils, dry mouth, dry, warm skin, decreased bowel sounds, and altered mental status. The patient may be agitated or seizing, or the patient may have decreased mental status, and may even become comatose. An EKG should be obtained early in the management of these patients, and any evidence of sodium and/or potassium channel blockade should be promptly addressed. Prolongation of QRS, due to sodium channel blockade of more than 100 milliseconds, is predictive of seizures while QRS > 160 milliseconds is predictive of arrhythmia. An R/S ratio in AVR of 0.7 or more and an R wave in the AVR lead more than 3 mm is strongly predictive of seizures and arrhythmias. In addition to basic lab investigations, including levels of possible co-investments, such as acetaminophen and aspirin, a CT scan of the head to rule out other causes of altered mental status should be done if clinically indicated. It should be noted that TCA levels do not correlate with toxicity, but may be helpful in diagnosing an unknown overdose when the clinical symptoms and signs point to a possible TCA ingestion. Any sign of toxicity warrants admission in an intensive care setting for at least 24 hours. Asymptomatic patients should be continuously monitored for signs of toxicity, changes in vital signs, and EKG for at least 6 hours. [8] [9] [10] [11]\nDocument [5] (Title: Anticholinergic Medications -- Toxicity) Toxicity from anticholinergic medications is essentially an extreme version of the\u00a0previously mentioned central and peripheral adverse effects. Clinical characteristics of anticholinergic toxicity include anhidrosis, anhidrotic hyperthermia, vasodilation-induced flushing, mydriasis, urinary retention, and neurological symptoms, including delirium, agitation, and hallucinations. The memory aid \u201cred as a beet, dry as a bone, blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, hot as a hare, full as a flask\u2019 often serves as means of remembering the common symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity. [21] Absent bowel sounds and tachycardia are among the first indications of acute anticholinergic toxicity. Anticholinergic toxicity is considered a clinical diagnosis, and there is currently no available testing to support the diagnosis. [21]\nDocument [6] (Title: Antiemetic Antimuscarinics -- Toxicity -- Signs and Symptoms of Overdose) Tachycardia, lethargy, convulsion, visual disturbance, dry flushed skin, dry mouth, urinary retention, agitation, coma, supraventricular arrhythmias, confusion, and hallucinations are signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity.\nDocument [7] (Title: Benztropine -- Adverse Effects -- Adverse Effects) The adverse effects of benztropine range in severity from mild to moderate to severe. [18] Mild adverse effects of benztropine may include fever, rash, general weakness, lethargy, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, paraesthesia, xerostomia, and mydriasis. Moderate adverse effects associated with benztropine may manifest as myasthenia, heatstroke, heat intolerance, or hyperthermia, visual hallucinations, delirium, confusion, toxic psychosis, depression, worsening of preexisting psychotic symptoms, blurred vision, cycloplegia, memory impairment, dry mouth, parotitis, dysuria, urinary tract infections, sinus tachycardia, constipation, and numbness of fingers. Severe adverse effects associated with benztropine may include toxic megacolon, ocular hypertension, paralytic\u00a0ileus [19] , and withdrawal of benztropine, leading to acute-onset dyskinesia. [20]\nDocument [8] (Title: Amoxapine -- Toxicity -- Signs and Symptoms of Overdose) The primary concern for TCA toxicity is the potential development of serotonin syndrome, particularly when the medication is combined with other antidepressants such as\u00a0SSRIs or SNRIs. Serotonin syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as hyperthermia, hypertension, muscle rigidity, and delirium.\nDocument [9] (Title: Atropine -- Toxicity -- Signs and Symptoms of Overdose) An overdose can lead to increased antimuscarinic adverse effects of dilated pupils, warm, dry skin, tachycardia, tremor, ataxia, delirium, and coma. In extreme toxicity, circulatory collapse secondary to respiratory failure may occur after paralysis and coma. Ten milligrams or less may be fatal to a child, while there is no known adult lethal dose.\nDocument [10] (Title: Trihexyphenidyl -- Toxicity -- Signs and Symptoms of Overdose) Trihexyphenidyl toxicity resembles atropine intoxication (antimuscarinic effects) with xerostomia, anhidrosis, mydriasis, nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, decreased bowel and bladder movements, rash, and hyperthermia, which usually accompany excessive doses. CNS symptoms observed with overdose include confusion, restlessness, agitation, incoordination, paranoid and psychotic reactions, delirium, and hallucinations. Reports exist of CNS depression leading to coma, respiratory and circulatory failure, and death in cases of severe overdose. [36] If the overdose does not receive prompt treatment, it could be fatal, especially in\u00a0younger children. [10]\nDocument [11] (Title: Pain Management Medications -- Toxicity -- Nonopioid analgesic agents) Antidepressant medications : Amitriptyline: Severe signs and symptoms of toxicity include confusion, transient visual hallucinations, mydriasis, agitation, dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, hyperreflexia, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia, coma, and death. Alteration\u00a0in the ECG,\u00a0particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of TCA\u00a0toxicity. Other abnormalities include prolonged PR interval, ST-T wave changes, ventricular tachycardia, and fibrillation. The absence of these findings does not exclude TCA poisoning. [7] [9] [28] Duloxetine:\u00a0Signs and symptoms of toxicity\u00a0include serotonin syndrome, somnolence,\u00a0syncope, tachycardia, seizures, autonomic instability, diarrhea, vomiting, and coma.\u00a0There is no antidote available for duloxetine overdose. Nonetheless, cyproheptadine and cooling measures merit consideration\u00a0in cases of serotonin syndrome. [41]\nDocument [12] (Title: Delirium Tremens(Archived) -- Complications) Seizures Disorientation Hypertension Hyperthermia Altered mental status Global confusion Arrhythmias Aspiration pneumonitis Respiratory failure Death\nDocument [13] (Title: Serotonin Syndrome -- Differential Diagnosis -- Anticholinergic Toxicity) Shared features of anticholinergic toxicity and serotonin syndrome include hyperthermia and delirium\u2014however, anticholinergic toxicity presents in the context of anticholinergic medications. The anticholinergic properties of most serotonergic agents are generally limited, except TCAs and paroxetine. Still, other psychiatric medications commonly have anticholinergic properties, and the potential for a mixed serotonin syndrome with anticholinergic toxicity is possible, particularly in the context of an intentional overdose of psychiatric medications. Anticholinergic toxicity also presents with dry mucous membranes, urinary retention, and decreased bowel sounds. In contrast, increased bowel sounds are a common feature of isolated serotonin syndrome. [9]\nDocument [14] (Title: Neuroleptic Medications -- Toxicity) The extrapyramidal symptoms include acute dystonia (tongue protrusion, facial grimacing, trismus, and oculogyric crisis) and akathisia (feeling of inner restlessness). The anticholinergic effects include tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, dry skin, decreased bowel sounds, and delirium. These symptoms\u00a0can be managed\u00a0with diphenhydramine\u00a025 to 50 mg IV/IM or benztropine\u00a01 to 2 mg IV/IM. Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes such as sinus tachycardia and QT prolongation can result from neuroleptic toxicity. With QTc prolongation of more than 500 ms, treatment with\u00a0magnesium 2 to 4 g IV over 10 minutes is indicated.\nDocument [15] (Title: Excited Delirium (Archived) -- Complications) The exact causes of morbidity and mortality in this patient population are still poorly understood. Without treatment, the natural course of the excited delirium syndrome potentially includes the development of rhabdomyolysis and subsequent acute renal failure, acute hepatotoxicity with transaminitis, and gross electrolyte derangement. Patients may further suffer myocardial infarction secondary to both demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and due to coronary vasospasm. Neurologic sequelae, including seizure and further autonomic dysfunction such as hyperthermia and progression to dysautonomia, may occur. Deaths reported in excited delirium syndrome often include lethal arrhythmias. An additional complication may come about due to the agitated/combative nature of the patient precluding full or timely evaluation and treatment. [8] As a result of their combative nature, patients are also at risk of committing acts of violence against first-responders and healthcare providers for which they may be subject to a significant legal consequence after the resolution of these symptoms.

Recognizing this specific form of poisoning helps clinicians identify the causative agent, assess the severity of the toxic reaction, and apply appropriate management strategies that are used for analgesic poisonings, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes.\nDocument [1] (Title: UMLS -- Run 22 -- Level 3 -- Community 2481) Accidental levomeprazine poisoning and accidental nefopam poisoning are both classified as types of accidental poisoning involving analgesic agents. These specific forms of drug overdose illustrate the toxic potential of the analgesics levomeprazine and nefopam when exposure occurs unintentionally, underscoring the importance of prevention, prompt recognition, and appropriate management in patient care for analgesic\u2011related accidental poisonings.\nDocument [2] (Title: UMLS -- Run 6 -- Level 3 -- Community 2406) Accidental poisoning by antidepressants is classified as a form of poisoning by psychotropic agents. Antidepressants, which are psychotropic medications used to treat mood disorders, can cause toxic effects when ingested unintentionally or in overdose, leading to an accidental poisoning scenario. Recognizing that such incidents fall under the broader category of psychotropic agent poisoning helps clinicians assess risk, implement appropriate treatment protocols, and develop preventive strategies for medication safety.\nDocument [3] (Title: UMLS -- Run 0 -- Level 3 -- Community 2295) The subacute confusional state (\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062f\u0629) and the organic hallucinosis syndrome (\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0636\u0648\u064a\u0629) are both classified as members of the cholinergic antagonist syndrome (\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u064f\u0636\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0651\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0651 (SMQ)). This categorization indicates that these clinical presentations are recognized manifestations associated with exposure to cholinergic antagonists, and grouping them under the SMQ facilitates systematic identification, monitoring, and management of adverse effects related to cholinergic blockade in patient care.\nDocument [4] (Title: UMLS -- Run 10 -- Level 1 -- Community 208) Accidental levomeprazine poisoning is categorized as a type of accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics, indicating that levomeprazine overdose falls within the broader group of analgesic\u2011related accidental poisonings. Accidental nefopam poisoning is likewise classified under accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics and is specifically linked to nefopam as the causative agent, highlighting the drug\u2011specific nature of this event. The category accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics itself is connected to the general concept of accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a), situating analgesic\u2011related poisonings within the overall framework of unintended toxic exposures. In addition to analgesics, accidental poisonings involving other drug classes\u2014such as antipsychotics and neuroleptics, fibrinolytics, and cholestyramine\u2014are all associated with the overarching accidental poisoning category (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a). Together, these relationships illustrate how diverse pharmaceutical agents, whether analgesics, antipsychotics, fibrinolytics, or bile\u2011acid sequestrants, can each give rise to distinct accidental poisoning scenarios that are unified under the general concept of accidental poisoning, informing clinicians about the need for awareness of drug\u2011specific risks and appropriate preventive and management strategies.\nDocument [5] (Title: UMLS -- Run 0 -- Level 3 -- Community 2245) Accidental levomeprazine poisoning and accidental nefopam poisoning are both classified as types of accidental poisoning involving analgesic agents. Accidental levomeprazine poisoning falls under the broader category of accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics, indicating that ingestion or exposure to levomeprazine in an unintended manner can lead to toxic effects. Similarly, accidental nefopam poisoning is also an instance of accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics, and it is specifically caused by the analgesic drug nefopam. Recognizing these specific forms of analgesic poisoning helps clinicians identify the responsible agents, assess risk, and implement appropriate treatment and preventive measures for patients who experience unintended exposure to levomeprazine or nefopam.\nDocument [6] (Title: UMLS -- Run 7 -- Level 3 -- Community 1787) Galantamin, ambenoniumchlorid and edrofonium are all classified as parasympathomimetic agents, meaning they stimulate the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. In addition to its parasympathomimetic properties, edrofonium is also recognized for its role as an antidote, indicating that it can be used to counteract the effects of certain toxic exposures or drug overdoses. The taxonomy linking edrofonium to parasympathomimetics suggests that these agents share a common mechanism of action, while edrofonium\u2019s dual classification highlights its therapeutic versatility in both enhancing parasympathetic function and providing antidotal protection. Understanding these relationships aids clinicians in selecting appropriate agents for conditions requiring parasympathetic stimulation and in managing situations where an antidotal effect is needed.\nDocument [7] (Title: UMLS -- Run 17 -- Level 3 -- Community 1517) Accidental poisoning by antipsychotics and neuroleptics is linked to the broader category of accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a). In the same way, accidental poisoning by cholestyramine is classified as a specific instance of accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a). Both conditions represent distinct drug\u2011induced forms of accidental poisoning, highlighting the importance of recognizing antipsychotics, neuroleptics, and cholestyramine as potential toxic hazards in patient care.\nDocument [8] (Title: UMLS -- Run 0 -- Level 3 -- Community 2262) Anti\u2011allergica en anti\u2011emetica, which denotes anti\u2011allergic and anti\u2011emetic medications, is conceptually linked to the condition described by the Arabic phrase \u201c\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0628\u0645\u0633\u0643\u0651\u0646\u0627\u062a \u062a\u0639\u062a\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0646\u0648\u062b\u064a\u0627\u0632\u064a\u0646\u201d (poisoning with analgesics that are based on phenothiazine). This relationship highlights that phenothiazine\u2011derived analgesic toxicity is relevant to the use or consideration of anti\u2011allergic and anti\u2011emetic agents in clinical assessment and management.\nDocument [9] (Title: UMLS -- Run 6 -- Level 2 -- Community 963) Accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics and accidental poisoning by opiate agonist are both classified within the broader E\u2011code category for poisoning. Within the analgesic poisoning group, accidental levomeprazine poisoning is identified as a specific type of accidental analgesic poisoning. Similarly, accidental nefopam poisoning is also a subtype of accidental analgesic poisoning and is directly linked to the drug nefopam as its causative agent. This hierarchy highlights how particular drug\u2011related poisonings are organized under general poisoning classifications, aiding clinicians in coding, diagnosis, and targeted management of such toxic exposures.\nDocument [10] (Title: UMLS -- Run 3 -- Level 1 -- Community 92) the anticholinergic pharmacologic class. Collectively, these entities and relationships demonstrate that alcohol, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, opioids, and other psychoactive drugs are interlinked through shared diagnostic categories, dependence mechanisms, poisoning risks, and pharmacologic interventions, which is essential for accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and prevention of toxic complications in patient care.\nDocument [11] (Title: UMLS -- Run 0 -- Level 3 -- Community 2246) Accidental poisoning by antipsychotics and neuroleptics, accidental poisoning by fibrinolytics, and accidental poisoning by cholestyramine are all specific instances of the broader condition described by the Arabic term \u201c\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a\u201d (accidental poisoning). Each of these drug\u2011related poisoning scenarios is linked to the general category of accidental poisoning, highlighting that exposure to antipsychotic and neuroleptic agents, fibrinolytic medications, or cholestyramine can result in unintended toxic events. Recognizing these particular agents as subtypes of accidental poisoning aids clinicians in promptly identifying, assessing, and managing such poisoning cases within the overall framework of \u201c\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a.\u201d\nDocument [12] (Title: UMLS -- Run 23 -- Level 2 -- Community 268) Accidental levomeprazine poisoning and accidental nefopam poisoning are both classified as types of accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics. Accidental levomeprazine poisoning occurs as a result of exposure to methotrimeprazin, making methotrimeprazin the causative agent of this specific poisoning. Similarly, accidental nefopam poisoning is caused by the analgesic drug nefopam, which serves as its causative agent. Recognizing these drug\u2011specific accidental poisonings within the broader category of analgesic toxicity is important for accurate diagnosis, appropriate management, and prevention of further exposure.\nDocument [13] (Title: UMLS -- Run 33 -- Level 1 -- Community 57) Accidental poisoning \u2013 analgesics is categorized under the e codes : poisoning classification and is considered a form of accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a). Within this category are several specific drug\u2011related poisonings, including accidental levomeprazine poisoning and accidental nefopam poisoning, the latter having nefopam identified as the causative agent. Accidental poisoning by opiate agonist, by antipsychotics and neuroleptics, by fibrinolytics, and by cholestyramine are also associated with the broader accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a) group. Disorder due to and following poisoning is defined as a subclass of poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645) and simultaneously as a subclass of poisoning by non\u2011medicinal substances, linking clinical sequelae to both medicinal and non\u2011medicinal toxic exposures. The general concept of poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645) is organized by the e codes : poisoning system, which classifies it, and it is further connected to specific toxic conditions such as \u201c\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0646\u062d\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0646\u201d and \u201c\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629.\u201d The overarching category \u201cPoisonings and Drug Effects\u201d is identified as the parent of poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645), situating all of these entities within a unified framework for understanding toxic exposures, their causes, and their clinical consequences.\nDocument [14] (Title: UMLS -- Run 26 -- Level 2 -- Community 349) Accidental poisoning (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0633\u0645\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636\u064a) encompasses several specific poisoning categories. Accidental poisoning \u2011 analgesics is a subtype of accidental poisoning and is classified under the e codes: poisoning system. Within this analgesic category, accidental levomeprazine poisoning is identified as a specific instance. Other distinct forms of accidental poisoning include accidental poisoning by opiate agonist, which is also linked to the e codes: poisoning classification, accidental poisoning by antipsychotics and neuroleptics, which is associated with the broader concept of accidental poisoning, and accidental poisoning by cholestyramine, which is a subclass of accidental poisoning. These relationships illustrate the hierarchical organization of poisoning types and their coding within the e codes: poisoning framework, aiding in systematic documentation and clinical management of poisoning cases.\nDocument [15] (Title: UMLS -- Run 17 -- Level 3 -- Community 1518) Accidental levomeprazine poisoning is classified as a type of accidental analgesic poisoning and results from exposure to methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine). This relationship underscores that methotrimeprazine, when inadvertently ingested or administered in excess, can lead to levomeprazine\u2011related toxic effects, highlighting the importance of careful handling and dosing of this medication to prevent poisoning.\n"
