    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with hypothermia (33\u00b0C), altered mental status, bradycardia (40/min), hypotension (80/50 mmHg), hyponatremia (120 mEq/L), and lab findings of elevated TSH (110 \u00b5U/mL) and low T4 (1.2 \u00b5g/dL). These are classic features of myxedema coma, a severe form of hypothyroidism. Document [0] and [7] explicitly link these findings to myxedema coma, emphasizing hypothermia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, bradycardia, and elevated TSH with low T4. Other options (pheochromocytoma crisis, septic shock, tertiary hyperparathyroidism) do not align with the clinical and lab profile. The case study in Document [2] and [5] further support this diagnosis in elderly patients with similar presentations.",
