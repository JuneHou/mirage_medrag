<think> Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The patient is a 68-year-old woman with left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation, described as crampy. She has a history of mild constipation. Her temperature is 37.8°C, which is a low-grade fever. Lab results show a high white blood cell count (16,000/mm³) with 89% neutrophils and 5% bands, indicating leukocytosis and a left shift. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit are normal, and she denies weight loss or urinary symptoms. Last menstrual period was 16 years ago, so she's postmenopausal. First, the key symptoms here are left lower quadrant pain associated with defecation, fever, and elevated WBC. The documents mention that diverticulitis often presents with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The MEDCORP documents specifically state that acute diverticulitis can cause crampy pain, changes in bowel habits (like constipation), and lab findings including elevated WBC and neutrophils. The presence of a tender mass in the left lower quadrant and the history of constipation align with diverticulitis. Looking at the other options: Hypothyroidism typically presents with weight gain, fatigue, and bradycardia, not abdominal pain or fever. Adenocarcinoma of the colon might present with changes in bowel habits, but usually with blood in stool, weight loss, and maybe anemia, which she doesn't have. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can cause crampy pain and constipation, but it's not associated with fever or elevated WBC. The documents also mention that diverticulitis can be confused with IBS, but the presence of fever and leukocytosis points more towards an inflammatory or infectious process like diverticulitis. The UMLS documents reinforce that diverticulitis is linked with left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The Hinchey classification in the MEDCORP documents talks about complications like abscesses, which would explain the fever and elevated WBC. The patient's age is also a risk factor for diverticulitis, as it's more common in older adults. So putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is diverticulitis. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with left lower quadrant pain worsening with defecation, fever, and leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance. MEDCORP documents explicitly link these findings to diverticulitis, noting crampy pain, constipation, and elevated WBC as key features. UMLS documents reinforce the association between diverticulitis and left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Other options (hypothyroidism, adenocarcinoma, IBS) lack supporting clinical or lab features. The age (68) and risk factors (constipation, fever, leukocytosis) align with diverticulitis.", "answer_choice": "A"}
