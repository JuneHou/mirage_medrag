    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and subacute back pain raise suspicion for bone metastasis. Documents 2, 3, and 7 highlight that NSCLC commonly metastasizes to bone, presenting with osteolytic lesions in the vertebral bodies. The pain's subacute onset and lack of trauma correlate with metastatic spread rather than mechanical injury. Imaging findings of lytic lesions (B) align with this mechanism, while other options (bulging disc, disc space narrowing, sacroilitis) are less consistent with cancer-related bone involvement.",
