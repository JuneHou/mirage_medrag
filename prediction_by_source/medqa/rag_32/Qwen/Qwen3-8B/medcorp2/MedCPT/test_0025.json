    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's recurrent infections with fungi (Aspergillus) and bacteria (Pseudomonas, Staph aureus) along with failed NBT test indicate a defect in neutrophil oxidative burst. The NBT test detects NADPH oxidase activity, which is critical for generating superoxide radicals during the respiratory burst. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), characterized by NADPH oxidase deficiency, causes NBT test failure and susceptibility to these pathogens. The respiratory burst (option D) is the process impaired here, not myeloperoxidase (C) or other components. Immunoglobulin class switching (A) and superoxide dismutase (B) are unrelated to this defect.",
