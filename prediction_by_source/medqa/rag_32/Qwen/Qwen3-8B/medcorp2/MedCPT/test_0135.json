    "step_by_step_thinking": "CD8+ T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class I molecules on infected cells. The MHC class I complex consists of a heavy chain and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m), which are transported to the cell surface. The heavy chain binds endogenous peptides generated from intracellular pathogens (like HIV) via the TAP channel. The immunoprecipitated CD8-bound protein likely refers to the MHC class I complex, which presents these endogenous peptides. The two-chain structure matches the MHC class I heavy chain and \u03b22m. This aligns with option C.",
