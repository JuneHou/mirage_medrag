<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 60-year-old woman who had a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligated multiple vessels. Post-op, she has left flank pain, oliguria, elevated creatinine, and hematuria. The question is which vessel ligation caused this. First, I need to recall the anatomy and possible complications of vessel ligation during a hysterectomy. The options are Artery of Sampson, Ovarian artery, Superior vesical artery, and Uterine artery. From the documents, Document [3] (Vaginal Hysterectomy Complications) mentions that during vaginal hysterectomy, common bleeding sites include uterine vessels, utero-ovarian ligament, and vaginal cuff. Also, ureteral injury is a risk, as is bladder injury. However, this is a laparoscopic hysterectomy, so maybe different vessels are involved. Document [0] (Postpartum Hemorrhage) talks about uterine artery ligation (O'Leary sutures) and hypogastric artery ligation. But the patient's issue is post-op renal issues. Document [9] (Renal Vein Thrombosis) mentions that left-sided RVT can lead to pelvic congestion syndrome. But the question is about vessel ligation during surgery causing acute issues. Document [7] (Nutcracker Syndrome) mentions left flank pain and hematuria, but that's more about venous compression. The key here is the post-op renal function decline and hematuria. The patient had ligation of vessels during hysterectomy. The superior vesical artery supplies the bladder and ureters. Ligation of this artery could affect the ureter, leading to ischemia. However, the question is about flank pain and hematuria. Wait, the options include the Artery of Sampson. From Document [15] (UMLS), the Artery of Sampson is mentioned in the context of renal artery branches. Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, specifically the superior vesical artery. Wait, maybe the Artery of Sampson is part of the uterine artery or ovarian artery? Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder. Ligation of this artery could lead to bladder ischemia, but how does that cause flank pain and hematuria? Alternatively, if the superior vesical artery is ligated, that could affect the ureter. Wait, the superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery. Ligation of this artery could lead to ischemia of the bladder and ureters. If the ureter is affected, that could cause obstruction, leading to flank pain and hematuria. But the patient's renal ultrasound is normal, so maybe there's no obstruction. Alternatively, the uterine artery is ligated. The uterine artery runs along the cervix and branches into the ovarian artery and the artery of the ovary. If the uterine artery is ligated, it could affect the ovarian artery, which supplies the ovary and the renal vessels. Wait, the ovarian artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta. But during hysterectomy, the uterine arteries are often ligated. However, if the uterine artery is ligated, it might affect the ovarian artery, leading to ischemia in the ovary, but how does that cause renal issues? Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder. If this is ligated, it could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria. But the patient's flank pain and oliguria might be due to renal artery involvement. Wait, but the options are between the four given. Looking back at the documents, Document [3] mentions that during vaginal hysterectomy, the most common bleeding sites are uterine vessels, utero-ovarian ligament, and vaginal cuff. The uterine artery is a common vessel ligated. However, if the uterine artery is ligated, it could affect the ovarian artery, which is a branch of the uterine artery. Wait, no—the ovarian artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta, and the uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery. The uterine artery and ovarian artery are separate. Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, specifically the superior vesical artery. Ligation of this artery could lead to bladder ischemia, which might cause hematuria. However, the patient's flank pain and oliguria might be due to renal artery involvement. But the options don't include the renal artery. Alternatively, the superior vesical artery is part of the internal iliac artery. If this is ligated, it could affect the bladder and ureters. If the ureter is damaged, that could lead to obstruction, but the renal ultrasound is normal. Wait, the patient's creatinine increased, indicating acute kidney injury. The renal ultrasound is normal, so maybe there's no obstruction. The hematuria and flank pain could be due to renal vein thrombosis or something else. Wait, the question is about vessel ligation during the hysterectomy. The options are Artery of Sampson, Ovarian artery, Superior vesical artery, Uterine artery. The Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, which supplies the bladder. Ligation of this artery could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria. However, the flank pain and oliguria might be due to renal artery involvement. But the options don't include the renal artery. Alternatively, the superior vesical artery is part of the internal iliac artery. Ligation of this artery could affect the bladder and ureters. If the ureter is damaged, that could lead to obstruction, but the renal ultrasound is normal. Wait, the patient's creatinine increased, which suggests acute kidney injury. The renal ultrasound is normal, so maybe there's no obstruction. The hematuria and flank pain could be due to renal vein thrombosis, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the uterine artery is ligated. The uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery. If the uterine artery is ligated, it could affect the ovarian artery, which is a branch of the abdominal aorta. Wait, no—the ovarian artery is a separate vessel. Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, specifically the superior vesical artery. If this is ligated, it could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria. The flank pain might be due to referred pain from the bladder. Oliguria could be due to bladder dysfunction. Alternatively, the superior vesical artery is ligated, leading to similar issues. But the options are between the four. The answer might be the Artery of Sampson (A), which is a branch of the internal iliac artery. However, I need to check the documents again. Looking at Document [15] (UMLS), the Artery of Sampson is mentioned in the context of the superior vesical artery. So, if the Artery of Sampson is ligated, it could cause bladder ischemia. Alternatively, the uterine artery is ligated, which is a common procedure. But the question is about the vessel ligation causing the post-op symptoms. The answer might be the Artery of Sampson (A), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the superior vesical artery (C) is part of the internal iliac artery. Wait, the answer is likely the Artery of Sampson (A), which is a branch of the internal iliac artery. Ligation of this artery could lead to bladder ischemia, causing hematuria and flank pain. The creatinine increase might be due to reduced renal perfusion if the artery is involved. But I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the patient had a hysterectomy, and during the procedure, the surgeon ligated multiple vessels. The options include the uterine artery, which is commonly ligated. However, the uterine artery is part of the internal iliac artery. If the uterine artery is ligated, it could affect the ovarian artery, but the ovarian artery is a separate vessel. Alternatively, the superior vesical artery is part of the internal iliac artery. Ligation of this artery could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria and flank pain. But the answer choices are A. Artery of Sampson, B. Ovarian artery, C. Superior vesical artery, D. Uterine artery. The Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, specifically the superior vesical artery. So, if the Artery of Sampson is ligated, it's the same as ligating the superior vesical artery. But the options are separate. Wait, the Artery of Sampson is a branch of the internal iliac artery, and the superior vesical artery is another branch. Maybe they are different. Alternatively, the answer is the uterine artery (D), but that's more commonly ligated. However, the symptoms point to renal involvement. Wait, the patient's creatinine increased, which suggests acute kidney injury. The renal ultrasound is normal, so maybe there's no obstruction. The hematuria and flank pain could be due to renal vein thrombosis, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the ligation of the uterine artery could affect the ovarian artery, leading to ischemia in the ovary, but that's not directly causing renal issues. I think the correct answer is the Artery of Sampson (A), which is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder. Ligation of this artery could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria and flank pain. The oliguria might be due to bladder dysfunction. So, the answer is A. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient developed flank pain, oliguria, hematuria, and elevated creatinine post-hysterectomy. During the procedure, vessel ligation occurred. The Artery of Sampson (a branch of the internal iliac artery) supplies the bladder and its ligation could cause bladder ischemia, leading to hematuria and flank pain. The superior vesical artery (C) is also part of the internal iliac artery and supplies the bladder, but the Artery of Sampson is specifically associated with bladder ischemia. Uterine artery (D) ligation is common but less directly linked to renal symptoms. Ovarian artery (B) ligation would affect the ovary, not the bladder or kidneys. The renal ultrasound being normal suggests no obstruction, aligning with bladder ischemia from Artery of Sampson ligation.", "answer_choice": "A"}
