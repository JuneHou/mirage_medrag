    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's chest X-ray shows depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. These findings are classic for traumatic bronchial rupture, particularly left mainstem injury, which can cause pneumomediastinum and mediastinal widening. While aortic rupture (C) is a differential, the specific bronchial injury signs (depressed bronchus, tube deviation) align more directly with traumatic bronchial rupture (B). Tension pneumothorax (D) would present with tracheal deviation but not bronchial depression. Diaphragmatic rupture (A) would show bowel herniation, which is absent here.",
