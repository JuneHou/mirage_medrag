    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes, low hemoglobin, elevated LDH), thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine), and a history of bloody diarrhea. These findings align with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is caused by Shiga toxin-producing bacteria (e.g., Shigella, E. coli O157:H7). The documents explicitly link HUS to bloody diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. While TTP shares some features, it is less associated with bloody diarrhea and more commonly presents with neurological symptoms. The history of recent gastrointestinal infection and the presence of schistocytes strongly favor HUS over other options like ITP or TTP.",
