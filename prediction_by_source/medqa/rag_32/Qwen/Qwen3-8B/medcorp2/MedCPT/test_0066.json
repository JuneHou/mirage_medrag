    "step_by_step_thinking": "The child presents with signs of peritonitis (guarding, rebound tenderness) and imaging consistent with bowel obstruction. Peritonitis requires emergent surgical intervention. In pediatric emergencies where parents cannot be reached, the standard of care is to proceed with life-saving surgery without delayed consent. The documents emphasize that peritonitis and intestinal obstruction mandate urgent laparotomy, and legal consent is not required when the child's life is at risk. Options A and B are invalid as the brother is not a legal guardian and the child cannot consent. Delaying surgery (D) would worsen outcomes. Thus, emergency laparotomy (C) is the correct step.",
