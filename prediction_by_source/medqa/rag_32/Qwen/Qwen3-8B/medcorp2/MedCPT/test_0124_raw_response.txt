<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The scenario is about a baby suspected of having congenital hypothyroidism due to maternal iodine deficiency. The question asks which sign or symptom would NOT be expected. First, I need to recall the typical symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism. From the documents, especially Document [2], it mentions that delayed treatment can lead to irreversible neurological deficits. Document [4] talks about treatment with levothyroxine and the importance of early intervention. Looking at the symptoms, the documents mention that congenital hypothyroidism presents with various signs. Document [1] and [3] list signs and symptoms. Common symptoms include hypotonia (low muscle tone), which is option A. Macroglossia (enlarged tongue) is also a classic sign, as mentioned in Document [2] and others. Umbilical hernia (option C) isn't specifically mentioned in the provided documents. However, I know from general knowledge that congenital hypothyroidism can cause delayed physical development, which might include umbilical hernias due to weak abdominal muscles. But wait, the question is about what is NOT expected. Diarrhea (option B) is a bit tricky. Hypothyroidism usually causes constipation, not diarrhea, because of slowed gastrointestinal motility. However, some sources might mention gastrointestinal issues. But the documents don't mention diarrhea as a symptom. Wait, the documents from MEDCORP mention that the initial symptoms might include things like poor feeding, jaundice, and hypotonia. Macroglossia is a classic sign. Hypotonia is definitely a symptom. Umbilical hernia might be a physical finding due to muscle weakness, but I'm not sure if it's a direct symptom. However, the question is which is NOT expected. Since the options are A, B, C, D. The answer is likely B. Diarrhea isn't a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Instead, constipation is more common. So the answer would be B. But wait, the user's options are A to D. Let me check again. The documents don't mention diarrhea as a symptom. So the answer is B. But wait, the options are A. Hypotonia (which is a symptom), B. Diarrhea (not a symptom), C. Umbilical hernia (possible), D. Macroglossia (symptom). So the answer is B. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "Congenital hypothyroidism typically presents with hypotonia (A), macroglossia (D), and umbilical hernia (C) due to muscle weakness and delayed development. Diarrhea (B) is not a classic symptom; instead, constipation is more common due to slowed gastrointestinal motility. The documents emphasize neurological and physical signs like hypotonia, macroglossia, and delayed milestones, but do not list diarrhea as a symptom.", "answer_choice": "B"}
