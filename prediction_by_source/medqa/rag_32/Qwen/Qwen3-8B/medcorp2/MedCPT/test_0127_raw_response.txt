<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient has monoclonal gammopathy with downregulated MHC class I on the plasma cells. The key here is understanding which immune cells can lyse abnormal cells without opsonization, priming, or prior activation. First, I remember that MHC class I downregulation is a strategy used by some cells to evade immune detection. Normally, cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) recognize antigens presented by MHC class I. If the cells downregulate MHC I, they might escape CTLs. But the question says the proliferation is prevented by a class of immune cells that don't need opsonization or prior activation. Natural killer (NK) cells come to mind. NK cells can kill cells that lack MHC class I, which is exactly what's happening here. They don't need antibodies or prior activation; they recognize missing self via MHC I downregulation. The other options: macrophages might be involved in phagocytosis, but they usually require opsonization. CD4+ T cells are helper cells, not directly cytotoxic. Neutrophils are phagocytic and also rely on opsonization. So the answer should be NK cells, option C. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The question describes monoclonal plasma cells downregulating MHC class I to evade immune detection.
