    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with ascites, fever, confusion, and elevated neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Low ascitic albumin (0.8 g/dL) and a SAAG of 1.8 g/dL indicate portal hypertension (cirrhosis). The neutrophil count (1900/mm\u00b3 with 60% PMN) and low glucose (62 mg/dL) are classic for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). While SBP is not an option, bacterial translocation (option C) is a key mechanism leading to SBP in cirrhotic patients. Aseptic inflammation (A) lacks infectious markers, neoplasia (B) typically has normal glucose, and perforated viscus (D) would present with free air on imaging. Thus, bacterial translocation is the most likely explanation for the findings.",
