    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to IgA nephropathy, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. In CKD, impaired renal function causes decreased calcitriol synthesis, leading to low calcium levels. Hyperphosphatemia occurs due to reduced phosphate excretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism results in increased PTH to compensate for low calcium. Thus, expected findings include increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, and decreased calcitriol. This matches option A.",
    "answer_choice": "A"
