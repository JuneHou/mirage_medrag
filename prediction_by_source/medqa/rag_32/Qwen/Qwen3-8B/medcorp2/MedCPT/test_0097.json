    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's recurrent gonorrhea despite prior treatment suggests immune evasion. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is known for antigenic variation, where it alters surface proteins (e.g., pilin, Opa proteins) to evade immune detection. This mechanism allows the bacteria to persist and cause reinfection. The other options (exotoxin release, polysaccharide capsule, Bruton's agammaglobulinemia) are less directly linked to recurrent infections due to antigenic variation. Documents 10 and 15 highlight resistance and immune evasion strategies, supporting antigenic variation as the key factor.",
