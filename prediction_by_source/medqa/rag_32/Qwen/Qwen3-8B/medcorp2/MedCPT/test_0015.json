    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and a calcified mass near the gallbladder. While gallbladder cancer (B) and choledocholithiasis (C) are considerations, the key differentiator is the pain characteristics. Pancreatitis (D) is classically associated with continuous epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. However, the question asks which diagnosis should be excluded first. Since the calcified mass could suggest gallbladder pathology (e.g., porcelain gallbladder or cancer), but the clinical presentation (pain radiation, vomiting) is more indicative of pancreatitis, which must be ruled out first. Acute cholecystitis (A) typically presents with localized right upper quadrant pain, not back radiation. Thus, pancreatitis is the priority to exclude.",
