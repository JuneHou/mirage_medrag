    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with fever, petechial rash, hypotension, altered mental status, and heavy menstrual bleeding, which are classic signs of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). TSS is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes toxins. The question links this condition to T cell receptor activation. CD3 is a critical component of the T cell receptor complex, essential for T cell activation and signaling. While B7 receptors are co-stimulatory molecules, CD3 directly participates in T cell receptor signaling. The variable \u03b2-sequence is part of the TCR's antigen-binding site, but the question emphasizes receptor activation, making CD3 the most relevant. IgCAMs are adhesion molecules, not directly linked to TSS pathogenesis. Thus, CD3 is the correct answer.",
