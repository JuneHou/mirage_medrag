    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with a 3-week-old male with an inward turning left forefoot, consistent with metatarsus adductus. Key findings include a skin crease below the great toe, convex lateral border, and correction with stimulation, indicating a flexible deformity. X-ray shows an increased 1st metatarsal angle, a hallmark of metatarsus adductus. The Ponseti method is for clubfoot, not metatarsus adductus. Conservative management is typically preferred for flexible cases, with 90% resolving spontaneously. However, the increased metatarsal angle suggests the need for intervention. The most appropriate next step is a foot abduction brace to correct the deformity, as described in the management of metatarsus adductus. Reassurance (C) is insufficient given the radiographic findings. Arthrodesis (B) and tarsometatarsal capsulotomy (D) are reserved for rigid or severe cases. Thus, the correct answer is A.",
