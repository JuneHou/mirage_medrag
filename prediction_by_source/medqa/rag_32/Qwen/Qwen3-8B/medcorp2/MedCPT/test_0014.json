    "step_by_step_thinking": "The question describes a process of viral reassortment, where two viruses from the same family co-infect a host, exchange genome segments, and produce a novel virus. The key is identifying a virus with a segmented genome capable of reassortment. The documents highlight influenza viruses (e.g., H1N1) as having segmented RNA genomes and being prone to reassortment. However, the options do not include influenza. Rotavirus (C) is mentioned in the documents as having a segmented genome, though not explicitly linked to reassortment. Vaccinia virus (D) is a poxvirus with a large DNA genome, not segmented. Epstein-Barr virus (A) and HIV (B) have non-segmented genomes. Since the process requires segmented genomes, Rotavirus (C) is the best fit among the options, even though the documents emphasize influenza. The answer must be C.",
    "answer_choice": "C"
