    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with normocytic anemia (MCV 90 fL), low hemoglobin (11.1 g/dL), and low reticulocytes (0.2%). Normocytic anemia with low reticulocytes suggests a hypoproliferative cause, such as iron deficiency, chronic disease, or hypothyroidism. While the patient is on iron supplementation, serum iron levels are critical to confirm iron deficiency, as low reticulocytes indicate ineffective erythropoiesis. The documents emphasize that iron deficiency anemia can present with normocytic features in early stages and requires evaluation of iron panel (including serum iron). Other options (B12, transferrin) are less directly linked to this presentation. Testing is necessary to confirm the cause.",
