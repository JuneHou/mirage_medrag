    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and palpitations, along with pressure-volume loop abnormalities, suggest left ventricular dysfunction. Increased ventricular wall stiffness (option C) leads to reduced compliance, causing elevated end-diastolic pressure and altered pressure-volume loop morphology. This aligns with findings in heart failure where increased stiffness impairs ventricular filling, leading to pulmonary congestion and symptoms. Documents [11] and [15] link ventricular stiffness to pressure-volume loop changes and elevated LVEDP, supporting this diagnosis over other options like impaired contractility or mitral regurgitation.",
