    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, elevated WBC, and inconclusive ultrasound. Cholescintigraphy shows bile ducts and small bowel but not the gallbladder. Obstruction of the cystic duct (D) would prevent gallbladder visualization on cholescintigraphy, leading to cholecystitis (classic symptoms: pain, fever, elevated WBC). A fistula (B) would allow contrast to spill into the small bowel, but fever and WBC elevation suggest infection rather than a non-obstructive fistula. Hepatotropic virus (C) or pancreatic autodigestion (A) do not align with the imaging findings. The most likely cause is cystic duct obstruction.",
