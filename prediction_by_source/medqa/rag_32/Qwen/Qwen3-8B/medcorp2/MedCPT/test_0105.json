    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's presentation includes a suicide attempt, impulsivity, turbulent relationships, and emotional dysregulation. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is explicitly linked to impulsivity, self-harm, unstable relationships, and affective instability in multiple documents (e.g., Document 1, 7, 13). The suicide attempt, history of manipulative behavior, and emotional lability (alternating between sobbing and anger) align with BPD criteria. Other options like Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) or Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) lack the core features of emotional dysregulation and self-harm. The documents emphasize BPD's association with suicide attempts and impulsivity, making it the most likely diagnosis.",
