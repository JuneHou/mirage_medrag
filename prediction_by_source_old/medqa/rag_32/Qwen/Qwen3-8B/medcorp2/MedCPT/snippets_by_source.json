        "tailored_query": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is a medical resident who made a mistake during a carpal tunnel repair by cutting a flexor tendon, which was then repaired. The attending told him not to report it in the operative note to avoid worrying the patient. The question is what the resident should do next. First, I need to focus on the UMLS. The key here is to find the correct next action for the resident. The options aren't given, but the answer likely relates to reporting the error. However, the attending is advising against it. But in medical practice, documentation is crucial. The resident might be conflicted between following the attending's instruction and the ethical duty to report. The correct action would probably involve reporting the error, but the question is about the next step. In UMLS, I need to find terms related to medical errors, documentation, and ethical guidelines. The query should include terms like \"medical error,\" \"documentation,\" \"ethical guidelines,\" \"complication reporting,\" and \"operative report.\" Also, considering the hierarchy of medical concepts, maybe \"complication\" and \"tendon injury\" are important. Wait, the user wants a query for UMLS. So, the query should be structured to find relationships in UMLS. Maybe using the concept of \"medical error\" and its relationships to \"reporting,\" \"documentation,\" and \"ethical guidelines.\" Also, the specific complication here is a flexor tendon injury during surgery. So, the query should include terms related to the complication (flexor tendon injury), the action (reporting), and the context (operative report). Also, considering the ethical aspect. Putting it all together, the UMLS query should look for relationships between \"flexor tendon injury\" and \"operative report,\" \"medical error,\" \"documentation,\" and \"ethical guidelines.\" Maybe using the semantic types like \"Complication,\" \"Procedure,\" \"Ethical Guideline,\" etc. I need to make sure the query is specific to UMLS. So, using the UMLS concept names and relationships. Maybe something like: \"flexor tendon injury\" related to \"operative report\" and \"medical error reporting.\" Also, including terms like \"ethical guidelines\" and \"documentation requirements.\" Wait, the user wants the query to be optimized for UMLS. So, perhaps using the UMLS concept identifiers or names. But since the user might not have specific identifiers, using the terms as they would be in UMLS. So, the query could be: \"flexor tendon injury AND operative report AND medical error reporting AND ethical guidelines.\" But I need to structure it for UMLS. Maybe using the semantic relationships. Alternatively, the query could be: \"flexor tendon injury\" related to \"complication\" and \"reporting\" in the context of \"operative procedure\" and \"ethical guidelines.\" I think the key is to find the relationship between the complication (flexor tendon injury) and the need to report it in the operative report, considering ethical guidelines. So, the UMLS query should focus on those concepts and their relationships. Therefore, the final query might be: \"flexor tendon injury complication AND operative report documentation AND medical error reporting AND ethical guidelines.\" But I need to make sure it's concise and specific. Alternatively, using the UMLS semantic types: \"Complication\" related to \"Procedure\" and \"Ethical Guideline.\" Hmm, maybe the best approach is to use the exact terms that would be in UMLS, like \"flexor tendon injury\" and \"operative report,\" and look for relationships such as \"complication,\" \"documentation,\" and \"ethical guidelines.\" So, the query would be: \"flexor tendon injury complication AND operative report documentation AND medical error reporting AND ethical guidelines.\" But I need to check if that's the right structure. Alternatively, using the UMLS concept names and relationships. For example, \"flexor tendon injury\" (C0006834) and \"operative report\" (C0031444), then looking for relationships like \"complication\" and \"documentation.\" But since the user wants a query tailored for UMLS, perhaps using the terms as they would be searched in the UMLS Metathesaurus. So, the query would be: \"flexor tendon injury AND operative report AND medical error AND ethical guidelines.\" I think that's the direction. The key is to include the specific complication, the document type (operative report), and the context of medical error and ethical guidelines. That should help find relevant information in UMLS about reporting complications, ethical considerations, and documentation requirements. </think> \"flexor tendon injury complication AND operative report documentation AND medical error reporting AND ethical guidelines\""
