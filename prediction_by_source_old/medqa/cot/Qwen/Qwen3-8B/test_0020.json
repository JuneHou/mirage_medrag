    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's history of radiation therapy for breast cancer is a known risk factor for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). While travel to Africa (A) could expose her to infections like malaria or HIV, which may contribute to lymphoma, the direct risk factor here is prior radiation. Axillary lymph node involvement (B) is a clinical finding, not a risk factor. Previous breast cancer (D) is a history but not a direct risk factor for NHL. Radiation therapy (C) is explicitly linked to secondary malignancies, including NHL.",
