    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's non-reactive nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test indicates a defect in the respiratory burst of neutrophils. The NBT test measures the ability of phagocytes to produce superoxide radicals, a key component of the respiratory burst. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is characterized by this defect, leading to recurrent infections by catalase-positive organisms like Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus aureus. The respiratory burst involves the production of reactive oxygen species, and its dysfunction directly correlates with the NBT test result. Myeloperoxidase (C) is involved in a later step of the oxidative burst, while superoxide dismutase (B) is not directly tested by the NBT assay. Immunoglobulin class switching (A) is unrelated to phagocyte function.",
