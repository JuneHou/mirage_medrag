    "step_by_step_thinking": "The infant presents with congenital clubfoot, characterized by inward turning of the forefoot, a medial skin crease, and a convex lateral border. The deformity is flexible (corrected by tickling the lateral border), indicating a flexible congenital clubfoot. Oligohydramnios and breech presentation are risk factors. X-ray findings of increased 1st-2nd metatarsal angle confirm the diagnosis. The Ponseti method is the gold standard, involving serial casting followed by a foot abduction brace (option A) to maintain correction. Arthrodesis (B) is for rigid deformities, reassurance (C) is inappropriate, and tarsometatarsal capsulotomy (D) is not standard initial management.",
