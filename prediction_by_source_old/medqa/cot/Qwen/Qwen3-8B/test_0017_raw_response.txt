<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is about a study on BRUE in infants. The pediatrician is trying to find risk factors by comparing two groups: 75 with BRUE and 75 without. The key here is that the study matched the groups based on age, socioeconomic background, and family history. The question is about which method was used to control confounding bias. First, I need to recall the different methods to control confounding. The options are blinding, restriction, randomization, and matching. Let me think about each. Blinding is about preventing bias in the study by keeping participants or researchers unaware of group assignments. But the question here isn't about how the study was conducted in terms of knowledge, so maybe not blinding. Restriction involves limiting the study population to exclude certain factors. For example, only including people of a certain age or background. The study here did match the groups on age, socioeconomic status, and family history, but they didn't restrict the sample. They included infants under 1 year, but the matching is about the variables, not restricting the selection. Randomization is when participants are randomly assigned to groups to ensure that confounders are evenly distributed. However, in this case, the groups were not randomly assigned. The study says they recruited 75 with BRUE and 75 without, matching them on certain factors. So randomization isn't the method here. Matching is when you pair or group participants so that the groups are similar in terms of confounding variables. The study explicitly mentions that they matched the two groups regarding age, socioeconomic background, and family history. So they controlled for these confounders by matching. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. Matching. Wait, but let me check again. The question says the study compared the two groups with regard to feeding problems and recent URI. The method used to control confounding was matching on age, socioeconomic, and family history. So the answer is D. Matching. The other options don't fit. So the answer choice is D. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The study controlled confounding by ensuring the BRUE and non-BRUE groups were matched on age, socioeconomic background, and family history. This method is called matching, as it pairs participants to balance confounding variables. Restriction would exclude certain groups, randomization assigns participants randomly, and blinding prevents bias in data collection. The described approach aligns with matching.", "answer_choice": "D"}
