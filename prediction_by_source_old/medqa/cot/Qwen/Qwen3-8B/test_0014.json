    "step_by_step_thinking": "The process described involves co-infection of a host cell by two viruses from the same family, followed by reassortment of genome segments to form a novel virus. This is characteristic of segmented viruses. Rotavirus (C) is a segmented double-stranded RNA virus in the Reoviridae family, which can undergo reassortment during co-infection. Other options (Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, Vaccinia virus) do not have segmented genomes or are not known for reassortment. Thus, the correct answer is C.",
