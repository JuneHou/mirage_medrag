<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the patient is a 35-year-old man with itchy, watery eyes and sneezing for a week. He had a similar episode a year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis, and is on ferrous sulfate, artificial tears, and indomethacin. His vitals are normal, visual acuity 20/20, and exam shows conjunctival injection with watery discharge. Pupils are normal, anterior chamber is fine. First, the symptoms point towards allergic conjunctivitis. The seasonal history (springtime) and the recurring nature suggest an allergic reaction. The sneezing and itchy eyes are classic signs of allergies. The patient is using artificial tears, which might be for dryness, but the main issue here is the allergic response. Now, looking at the treatment options. The choices are Erythromycin ointment (A), Ketotifen (B), Warm compresses (C), Fluorometholone (D). Erythromycin is an antibiotic, so that's for bacterial infections. But the patient doesn't have signs of infection like purulent discharge or redness beyond conjunctival injection. So probably not A. Ketotifen is an antihistamine eye drop. Antihistamines are used for allergic conjunctivitis. That makes sense here. So B is a candidate. Warm compresses (C) are more for conditions like styes or blocked glands, not allergic reactions. So probably not C. Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid. While steroids can be used for allergic conjunctivitis, they're usually reserved for more severe cases or when antihistamines aren't enough. Also, long-term use can lead to side effects like glaucoma or cataracts. Since the patient's symptoms are mild (watery discharge, itchy eyes) and there's no mention of severe inflammation, steroids might not be the first choice. Plus, the patient is already using artificial tears, which might be part of managing symptoms. So the best option here is B, Ketotifen eye drops, as they target the allergic response directly. The other options either treat different conditions or are not appropriate for the severity presented. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, evidenced by itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, and a history of similar episodes. Ketotifen is an antihistamine eye drop effective for allergic conjunctivitis. Erythromycin is antibiotic (not indicated here), warm compresses are for non-allergic conditions, and fluorometholone (steroid) is reserved for severe cases due to potential side effects. The most appropriate treatment is antihistamine eye drops.", "answer_choice": "B"}
