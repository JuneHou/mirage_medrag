<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. The patient is a 39-year-old man with chest pain and nausea that started 30 minutes ago. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a history of untreated hypertension, smoking a pack a day for 5 years, and recent cocaine abuse. He's diaphoretic and in distress. First, the main concern here is acute chest pain. The differential diagnoses include cardiac issues like myocardial infarction (MI), especially given his risk factors. Cocaine use can cause coronary vasospasm, leading to MI even in the absence of traditional risk factors. The epigastric radiation is concerning for MI, as that's a common symptom. Also, his untreated hypertension and smoking add to the risk. The question is about the first step in management. The options are medications and reassurance. Let's look at the options. Diltiazem (A) is a calcium channel blocker, used for angina and hypertension. Labetalol (B) is a beta-blocker and alpha-blocker, used for hypertension and acute hypertension. Propranolol (C) is a beta-blocker, but it's not typically first-line in acute MI. Reassurance and monitoring (D) might be considered if the patient is stable, but he's in marked distress, so that's probably not right. But wait, in acute MI, the first steps are usually to stabilize the patient, administer aspirin, oxygen, and maybe nitroglycerin. However, the options here don't include those. The options are about medications. The patient is in distress, so maybe they need to manage blood pressure. However, cocaine can cause tachycardia and hypertension. Beta-blockers like propranolol (C) are contraindicated in cocaine-induced MI because they can worsen coronary artery spasm. Labetalol (B) is a safer beta-blocker, but again, in the setting of cocaine, maybe not. Diltiazem (A) is a calcium channel blocker, which can be used for vasospasm. But in acute MI, beta-blockers are generally avoided if there's a history of cocaine use. Wait, but the first step in management of acute MI is usually to give aspirin, oxygen, and nitroglycerin. But the options here don't include those. The options are about medications to administer. So, the question is, which of these is the first step. Since the patient is in distress, maybe they need to manage blood pressure. But the answer choices are limited. Alternatively, maybe the question is about managing the cocaine-induced hypertension. But the key here is that the patient's symptoms are consistent with MI. However, the options given are all medications. Let me think again. The first step in management of acute MI is to give aspirin, but that's not an option here. The options are Diltiazem, Labetalol, Propranolol, or reassurance. Since the patient is in marked distress, reassurance (D) is probably not the first step. The other options are medications. But in the case of cocaine-induced MI, beta-blockers are contraindicated. So Propranolol (C) would be contraindicated. Labetalol (B) is a beta-blocker and alpha-blocker, but in the setting of cocaine, maybe it's not the best choice. Diltiazem (A) is a calcium channel blocker, which can be used for vasospasm. However, in acute MI, calcium channel blockers are not typically first-line. Wait, but the patient's presentation could be due to cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm, which is a type of MI. In that case, calcium channel blockers like diltiazem might be used. However, the first step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. But given the options, maybe the answer is Diltiazem (A) for the vasospasm. Alternatively, if the patient is hypertensive, maybe labetalol (B) is used. But the patient's main issue is chest pain, not necessarily hypertension. Wait, the patient has a history of untreated hypertension, and cocaine use can cause acute hypertension. But the primary concern is the chest pain. So, the first step would be to manage the acute MI. However, the options don't include aspirin or nitroglycerin. So, given the options, which is the best choice? If the patient is in acute MI, beta-blockers are generally avoided in cocaine use. So Propranolol (C) is contraindicated. Labetalol (B) is a safer option for hypertension. But the question is about the first step. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Diltiazem (A) for the vasospasm. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check standard guidelines. In cocaine-induced MI, the management includes avoiding beta-blockers. So, the first step would be to give aspirin, nitroglycerin, and maybe morphine. But since those aren't options, the answer might be Diltiazem (A) for vasospasm. Alternatively, if the patient is hypertensive, labetalol (B) could be used. But the question is about the first step. The answer might be Diltiazem (A) because of the cocaine-induced vasospasm. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is D (reassurance and monitoring), but that seems unlikely given the patient's distress. So, between A, B, and C. Since Propranolol is contraindicated in cocaine use, C is out. Labetalol is a beta-blocker, but in the setting of cocaine, maybe it's not the best. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker, which can be used for vasospasm. So the answer might be A. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B. Wait, but the first step in management of acute MI is to give aspirin, but that's not an option. So given the options, the best choice is Diltiazem (A) for the vasospasm. So the answer is A. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with acute chest pain, nausea, and epigastric radiation, along with a history of cocaine use, untreated hypertension, and smoking. Cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm is a key consideration, which can mimic myocardial infarction (MI). Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are contraindicated in cocaine use due to risk of coronary artery spasm. Labetalol, while a beta-blocker, may also be avoided in this context. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is used to treat vasospasm and is safer in cocaine-induced coronary artery spasm. Reassurance (D) is inappropriate given the patient's distress and acute presentation. The first step is to address the vasospasm with diltiazem.", "answer_choice": "A"}
