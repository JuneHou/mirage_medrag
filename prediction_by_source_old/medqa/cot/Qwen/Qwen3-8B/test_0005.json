    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with acute chest pain, nausea, and epigastric radiation, along with a history of cocaine use, untreated hypertension, and smoking. Cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm is a key consideration, which can mimic myocardial infarction (MI). Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are contraindicated in cocaine use due to risk of coronary artery spasm. Labetalol, while a beta-blocker, may also be avoided in this context. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, is used to treat vasospasm and is safer in cocaine-induced coronary artery spasm. Reassurance (D) is inappropriate given the patient's distress and acute presentation. The first step is to address the vasospasm with diltiazem.",
