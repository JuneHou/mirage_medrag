    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's asthma is allergic in nature, with symptoms worsening during pollen exposure. The experimental therapy targets a mediator involved in antibody class switching, specifically reducing IgE production (key in allergic responses). IL-4 is the primary cytokine driving class switching to IgE, making it the target. IL-13 also contributes to Th2 responses but is not the main mediator for class switching. Thus, the correct answer is D.",
