    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with classic signs of croup (seal-like cough, stridor, hoarseness, respiratory distress). Croup is caused by viral infection (e.g., parainfluenza) leading to subglottic edema. Chest X-ray findings in croup typically show a 'steeple sign' on the lateral view due to subglottic narrowing. The 'thumbprint sign' (C) is associated with foreign body aspiration. Increased interstitial markings (A) and lobar consolidation (B) suggest pneumonia, which is not indicated here. The steeple sign (D) is the correct finding.",
