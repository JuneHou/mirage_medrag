    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, leukocytosis, and normal liver enzymes. Ultrasound is inconclusive, but cholescintigraphy shows bile ducts and proximal small bowel. Obstruction of the cystic duct (D) would cause acute cholecystitis, consistent with her symptoms.
