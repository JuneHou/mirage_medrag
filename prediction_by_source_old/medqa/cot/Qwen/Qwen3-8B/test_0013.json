    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with a mid-systolic murmur at the 2nd left intercostal space radiating to the carotids, suggesting aortic stenosis. When standing, venous return decreases, reducing preload. This leads to a reflex increase in heart rate, which shortens diastolic filling time. The maneuver reduces diastolic filling time (D) due to increased heart rate. Other options are incorrect: right atrial pressure decreases (A), PCWP decreases (B), and pacemaker potential slope is not directly affected (C).",
