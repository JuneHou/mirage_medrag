    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of pancreatitis. While gallstones (cholelithiasis) are a known risk factor for pancreatitis, the CT finding of a calcified mass near the gallbladder could suggest gallstones. However, the question asks which diagnosis should be excluded first. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with localized right upper quadrant pain, fever, and Murphy's sign, which are not emphasized here. Gallbladder cancer is suggested by the family history and calcified mass, but the acute presentation points more toward pancreatitis. Choledocholithiasis could cause biliary colic, but the severe, radiating pain and vomiting are more indicative of pancreatitis. Thus, pancreatitis should be the first diagnosis to consider and exclude.",
