    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient's symptoms of sensorineural hearing loss are likely due to ototoxicity from cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic agent for bladder cancer. Cisplatin's primary mechanism of action is DNA cross-linking, which causes cell death in cancer cells (beneficial effect). The ototoxicity arises from similar DNA damage in the inner ear. The question asks about the mechanism of the drug's beneficial effect, not the ototoxicity itself. Thus, the correct answer is DNA cross-linking.",
