    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with classic symptoms of acute pericarditis: sharp, constant chest pain worsening with lying down and improving with leaning forward, radiation to shoulders/neck, and a pericardial friction rub. The ECG findings (not visible but inferred from symptoms) would likely show ST-segment elevation and PR depression. Treatment for acute pericarditis typically includes NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen or indomethacin) and colchicine to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrence. Omeprazole is added to mitigate NSAID-induced GI side effects. Pericardiocentesis (C) and pericardiectomy (D) are not indicated here as there is no evidence of tamponade or constrictive pericarditis. While both A and B include NSAIDs and omeprazole, B adds colchicine, which is a standard adjunct in acute pericarditis. However, the question's answer choice A might be considered if the ECG is normal (e.g., early pericarditis) and colchicine is not explicitly required. But based on standard guidelines, B is optimal.",
