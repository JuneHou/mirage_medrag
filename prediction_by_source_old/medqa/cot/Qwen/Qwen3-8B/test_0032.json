    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient presents with pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, platelets, and WBC) and blood cultures growing coagulase-negative staphylococci. The key is identifying the antibiotic causing bone marrow suppression. Chloramphenicol is known for causing aplastic anemia (severe bone marrow suppression), while Linezolid can cause thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Given the pancytopenia, Chloramphenicol (D) is more likely. However, Linezolid (C) is also a possibility. But since the patient had meningitis, Linezolid is used for resistant gram-positive infections, and its bone marrow suppression is less severe than Chloramphenicol. The answer is Linezolid (C) due to its association with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in this context.",
