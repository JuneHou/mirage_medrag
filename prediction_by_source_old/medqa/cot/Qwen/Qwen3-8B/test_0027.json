    "step_by_step_thinking": "The patient is on rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, which metabolizes hormones in oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and progestins). This induction reduces their serum levels, decreasing contraceptive efficacy. Other drugs (isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) do not significantly affect OCs via the mechanisms described. Option A correctly identifies rifampin's role in CYP3A4 induction leading to hormone inactivation.",
