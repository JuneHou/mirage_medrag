<think> Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is a junior orthopaedic resident accidentally cuts a flexor tendon during a carpal tunnel repair. The attending surgeon tells the resident not to report it because it's a minor complication that won't harm the patient and to avoid making the patient worry. The question is what the resident should do next. First, I need to recall medical ethics and legal obligations. The key points here are informed consent and documentation. The resident is part of the surgical team, so they have a duty to report any complications, even if they're minor. The attending is asking the resident to omit the error from the operative report, which is against standard practice. Informed consent requires that patients are aware of all risks, including those that occur during surgery. If a complication happens, even if it's minor, it should be documented. The resident has a responsibility to report it, not just to the attending but also to the patient if necessary. However, the attending might be trying to protect the patient's feelings, but the resident's duty is to ensure transparency and proper documentation. Looking at the options: A. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the report. This seems correct because transparency is important. The resident should report it even if the attending doesn't want to. B. Tell the attending he can't fail to disclose. This might be part of the process, but the question is about the next action. The resident might need to report it, but the answer might be A. C. Report to ethics committee. That's more for serious breaches, maybe not necessary here unless there's a pattern. D. Refuse to dictate the report. If the resident is being asked to omit the error, refusing to dictate might be a step, but the correct action is to disclose. Wait, the attending is telling the resident not to report it. The resident's duty is to report the error. So the correct action would be to disclose it. So A is the answer. But the attending is the one who is instructing not to report. The resident might need to follow the attending's orders, but in this case, the attending is wrong. The resident has a duty to report. So the correct next action is to disclose and document. Therefore, A is the answer. </think> {"step_by_step_thinking": "The resident is obligated to report medical errors, even minor ones, to ensure transparency and proper patient care. Omitting the complication from the operative report violates documentation standards and ethical guidelines. Disclosing the error to the patient and documenting it in the report is the correct action to uphold patient autonomy and informed consent. The attending's request to conceal the error is inappropriate, and the resident must prioritize patient safety and ethical reporting.", "answer_choice": "A"}
